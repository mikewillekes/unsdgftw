These pensions are funded largely from the state budget, with contributory pensions being recently introduced.

A disability pension that is equal to the basic pension is available to residents ages 15-64, but in order to be eligible, an individual must be declared 100 percent disabled;14 the number of beneficiaries in 2020 was approximately 19,000.15 There are also separate more generous government-funded pensions for the blind (available since 2014, with almost 2,000 beneficiaries in 2020) and paraplegic/tetraplegic persons (available since 2018, with almost 3,000 beneficiaries in 2020).16 Separate work invalidity (for those declared 100 percent disabled as a result of work injury or illness) and survivors (family) pensions were introduced in 2018. Family pensions are only selectively granted to some categories of surviving beneficiaries such as families of war-related pensioners and contributors to the old (former Yugoslav) system. In 2020, almost 4,000 individuals received the family pension, and about 80 received the work invalidity pension. In total, disability pensions amounted to 7 percent of total spending on cash transfers in 2019 (Figure 6). Over the last decade, spending on disability pensions has increased from 0.28 percent of GDP in 2009 to 0.5 percent in 2019; the increase is due to the more generous pensions for the blind and for paraplegics and tetraplegics as well as an increase in beneficiaries (from about 18,500 in 2009 to almost 24,000 in 2020).", "sentences": [{"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.S0", "text": "Spending on disability pensions has increased but is limited to those declared 100 percent disabled."}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.S1", "text": "A disability pension that is equal to the basic pension is available to residents ages 15-64, but in order to be eligible, an individual must be declared 100 percent disabled;14 the number of beneficiaries in 2020 was approximately 19,000.15"}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.S2", "text": "There are also separate more generous government-funded pensions for the blind and paraplegic/tetraplegic persons.16"}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.S3", "text": "Separate work invalidity and survivors pensions were introduced in 2018."}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.S4", "text": "Family pensions are only selectively granted to some categories of surviving beneficiaries such as families of war-related pensioners and contributors to the old system."}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.S5", "text": "In 2020, almost 4,000 individuals received the family pension, and about 80 received the work invalidity pension."}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.S6", "text": "In total, disability pensions amounted to 7 percent of total spending on cash transfers in 2019."}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.S7", "text": "Over the last decade, spending on disability pensions has increased from 0.28 percent of GDP in 2009 to 0.5 percent in 2019; the increase is due to the more generous pensions for the blind and for paraplegics and tetraplegics as well as an increase in beneficiaries."}], "entities": [{"id": "d296add506bba3096a4fc9610f514b5149710f4bcad72f0cd5c4c7e7b45b1a1e", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.PHRASE0", "text": "disability", "label": "PHRASE"}, {"id": "d296add506bba3096a4fc9610f514b5149710f4bcad72f0cd5c4c7e7b45b1a1e", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.PHRASE1", "text": "disability", "label": "PHRASE"}, {"id": "d296add506bba3096a4fc9610f514b5149710f4bcad72f0cd5c4c7e7b45b1a1e", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.PHRASE2", "text": "disability", "label": "PHRASE"}, {"id": "d296add506bba3096a4fc9610f514b5149710f4bcad72f0cd5c4c7e7b45b1a1e", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG15.PA3.PHRASE3", "text": "disability", "label": "PHRASE"}]}

Non-contributory, government-financed pensions include a universal, tax-financed basic pension (or old-age pension) payable to all permanent residents of Kosovo age of 65 years and older, with incremental basic pension levels for those who contributed at least 15 years to the former Yugoslav pension system prior to 1999. Separate early retirement benefits with different rules apply to Trepca Company, Kosovo Protection Corps, Kosovo Security Force and war veterans pensions.28 Further, a multitude of war-related pensions cover civilians and soldiers who became disabled during the 1998-99 military conflict and protect the surviving relatives of fallen soldiers and civilians as well as the families of those missing.29 There are also government-financed disability and survivors pensions (discussed in the cash transfers section above). Finally, a defined contri- bution pension, which was established in 2002, is fully funded through mandatory contributions by employers and employees and is managed by an independent public entity (Kosovo Pensions Savings Trust, KPST).30,31", "sentences": [{"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.S0", "text": "Kosovos pension system has universal coverage."}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.S1", "text": "Non-contributory, government-financed pensions include a universal, tax-financed basic pension payable to all permanent residents of Kosovo age of 65 years and older, with incremental basic pension levels for those who contributed at least 15 years to the former Yugoslav pension system prior to 1999."}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.S2", "text": "Separate early retirement benefits with different rules apply to Trepca Company, Kosovo Protection Corps, Kosovo Security Force and war veterans pensions.28"}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.S3", "text": "Further, a multitude of war-related pensions cover civilians and soldiers who became disabled during the 1998-99 military conflict and protect the surviving relatives of fallen soldiers and civilians as well as the families of those missing.29"}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.S4", "text": "There are also government-financed disability and survivors pensions."}, {"id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.S5", "text": "Finally, a defined contri- bution pension, which was established in 2002, is fully funded through mandatory contributions by employers and employees and is managed by an independent public entity.30,31"}], "entities": [{"id": "3a9485a3583a3b20359a2fadd41c134457bb4bcfefaf3d070f2a623c508d9778", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.GPE0", "text": "Kosovos", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "c2bab6893136364f76c2f63980c006a210c3bed758d483e580f3d4ed852095ea", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.GPE1", "text": "Kosovo", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "d0d07567e97dbf0a53bca7fdc2afa617c68571369890a84688cfab5c8b5aed99", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.NORP4", "text": "Yugoslav", "label": "NORP"}, {"id": "1015e8a6a8ea80d040926d2539ac7f0bd209fac5bfc26b34674ac205178c82ba", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.ORG6", "text": "Trepca Company", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "b5cc171c18d01290b56046cf2125f8ee3955ae9d9a0d8017e1b27b0791ae0020", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.ORG7", "text": "Kosovo Protection Corps", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "c46166f842f1a8815f0ef89e369b2c0def5c65b0187c213da1d4e753323d9b47", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.ORG8", "text": "Kosovo Security Force", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "d296add506bba3096a4fc9610f514b5149710f4bcad72f0cd5c4c7e7b45b1a1e", "mention_id": "28f16758ece77f033fccd40e157e756cdb5fc71c9a5279b649293dbac9312b10.PG20.PA4.PHRASE0", "text": "disability", "label": "PHRASE"}]}
