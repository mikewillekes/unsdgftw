The multiplying effect of reducing gender inequalities. Addressing gender inequality and its drivers is a common challenge across many contexts and operations. Tackling these inequalities is a development priority in its own right, especially in FCV situations, where women and girls are often a large share of refugees and IDPs. Disruptions to education will leave girls especially vulnerable to early pregnancies and early marriage, as well as at greater risk than boys of not returning the school. Addressing social norms and other sources of discrimination that underpin gender-based disadvantagesuch as enrollment gaps between boys and girls, labor market discrimination against women, and policy frameworks that are unfavorable to womenwill go a long way toward restoring social justice and fostering greater cohesion across groups.

A meta-analysis of 29 formal preschool programs for children aged 3 to 5 in the United States, targeted to children at risk of academic failure and other negative outcomes, showed that children in programs using a SEL curriculum demonstrated significantly improved socio-emotional competence (Yang et al., 2018). These included the following measures: (a) attention and selfregulation (ability to control aggressive-oppositional impulses); (b) cooperation (interpersonal skills in interaction and negotiation with others); (c) emotional understanding and expression (emotion identification, expression of feelings, and situational knowledge associated with emotions); (d) positive coping behavior (adaptive/constructive actions in response to challenging social situations); (e) positive feelings (confidence); and (f) social skills (helping others, giving compliments). These competencies are all associated with violence prevention and with pro-social attitudes and behaviors. f https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/32553/142659.pdf?sequence=7 g http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/250981606928190510/pdf/Realizing-the-Future-of-Learning-From-Learning-Poverty-to-Learning-for-", "sentences": [{"id": "c6489a47009af4c5a92dac3c191be9b9ca327ba00314593ebd15cc9d6fd663d1.PG59.PA7.S0", "text": "Early childhood activities that integrate socioemotional learning curricula have been shown to be particularly effective among disadvantaged groups."}, {"id": "c6489a47009af4c5a92dac3c191be9b9ca327ba00314593ebd15cc9d6fd663d1.PG59.PA7.S1", "text": "A meta-analysis of 29 formal preschool programs for children aged 3 to 5 in the United States, targeted to children at risk of academic failure and other negative outcomes, showed that children in programs using a SEL curriculum demonstrated significantly improved socio-emotional competence."}, {"id": "c6489a47009af4c5a92dac3c191be9b9ca327ba00314593ebd15cc9d6fd663d1.PG59.PA7.S2", "text": "These included the following measures: attention and selfregulation; cooperation; emotional understanding and expression; positive coping behavior; positive feelings; and social skills."}, {"id": "c6489a47009af4c5a92dac3c191be9b9ca327ba00314593ebd15cc9d6fd663d1.PG59.PA7.S3", "text": "These competencies are all associated with violence prevention and with pro-social attitudes and behaviors."}, {"id": "c6489a47009af4c5a92dac3c191be9b9ca327ba00314593ebd15cc9d6fd663d1.PG59.PA7.S4", "text": "f https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/32553/142659.pdf?sequence=7"}, {"id": "c6489a47009af4c5a92dac3c191be9b9ca327ba00314593ebd15cc9d6fd663d1.PG59.PA7.S5", "text": "g http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/250981606928190510/pdf/Realizing-the-Future-of-Learning-From-Learning-Poverty-to-Learning-for-"}], "entities": [{"id": "981e5b396726008318fcca73b116e69d1680fdbe17a7fb078d10197731f1e700", "mention_id": "c6489a47009af4c5a92dac3c191be9b9ca327ba00314593ebd15cc9d6fd663d1.PG59.PA7.GPE2", "text": "the United States", "label": "GPE"}]}
