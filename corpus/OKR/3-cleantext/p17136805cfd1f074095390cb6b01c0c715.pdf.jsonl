In comparison to other countries, the government of Kenya was highly committed to ensuring that the education of primary school learners with disabilities are educated in mainstream rather than special schools. Of central importance to this are the Educational Assessment and Resource Centers (EARCs), which are responsible for screening children with disabilities, assessing AT and EdTech needs, and supporting the development of individualized educational plans. However, many of the EARCs, especially in rural areas, lack the necessary financial, material, and human resources to appropriately assess children with disabilities for more complex learning needs. They rarely have access to adequate EdTech resources that would enable them to test the use of different EdTech to find the best match for childrens needs. Finally, EARCs tend to operate almost independently from each other. To date, there is no national structure that would enable them to collect and share comprehensive data concerning the functional and educational needs of children with disabilities.", "sentences": [{"id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.S0", "text": "The policy framework for Inclusive education and ICT use is rather comprehensively structured."}, {"id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.S1", "text": "In comparison to other countries, the government of Kenya was highly committed to ensuring that the education of primary school learners with disabilities are educated in mainstream rather than special schools."}, {"id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.S2", "text": "Of central importance to this are the Educational Assessment and Resource Centers, which are responsible for screening children with disabilities, assessing AT and EdTech needs, and supporting the development of individualized educational plans."}, {"id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.S3", "text": "However, many of the EARCs, especially in rural areas, lack the necessary financial, material, and human resources to appropriately assess children with disabilities for more complex learning needs."}, {"id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.S4", "text": "They rarely have access to adequate EdTech resources that would enable them to test the use of different EdTech to find the best match for childrens needs."}, {"id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.S5", "text": "Finally, EARCs tend to operate almost independently from each other."}, {"id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.S6", "text": "To date, there is no national structure that would enable them to collect and share comprehensive data concerning the functional and educational needs of children with disabilities."}], "entities": [{"id": "3b5f7a488f457a7e53fea34f11eb7848d1325be3d892fc5761bd7778d34dc4a8", "mention_id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.GPE0", "text": "Kenya", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "dbd0f1e0fa5038d16836a196d24b35c2f6649ed6abd09a0324983ff45e79021b", "mention_id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.ORG1", "text": "the Educational Assessment and Resource Centers", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "93d5d4b2ef5ea8fc81220caf262ffaaeeb01771a942261332cb488ed926366f4", "mention_id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.ORG2", "text": "EARCs", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "b5f270a406be9005ef2f8c5ceb402b47dc51cd6e721dd9a8ee543e235aa2a804", "mention_id": "8dc227992513ad02fcd0bb41c0ab57febd707f78bdddfa0bd37f17ddcac7a8c7.PG64.PA6.ORG3", "text": "EdTech", "label": "ORG"}]}

Products: Most EdTech devices and software are too expensive for families and schools, limiting their affordability and accessibility.
