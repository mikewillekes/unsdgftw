The approach used in this report explored the factors or drivers of vulnerability by examining five distinct types of constraints: physical, financial, information, attitudinal, and institutional. These constraints may prevent people from accessing critical markets, services, and spaces with dignity. By shifting attention to shortcomings in the social system rather than focusing on peoples abilities, this perspective acknowledges marginalized groups as agents of change, emphasizing that the adverse effects of disasters on these groups are avoidable. Understanding the underlying risk factors is a key element of DRM. Inclusive DRM approaches pay special attention to various factors related to vulnerability beyond the hazard itself or the likelihood of exposure.

While GFDRR has funded guidance notes for disability-inclusive DRM, which include M&E frameworks and standards (GFDRR 2020c), up to now there has not been a systematic approach to monitor the disability agenda. A GFDRR portfolio review found many missed opportunities to incorporate disability-inclusion aspects into grant activities (GFDRR 2020b, 4). As a starting point, the inclusion of the Washington Group Questions in M&E frameworks is widely recommended by disability stakeholders (GFDRR 2020c, 21). Yet, the Washington Group Questions do not set standards to measure inclusion and accessibility barriers (apart from the Inclusive Education Module). Hence, additional efforts are needed to collect data on disability-informed outputs and outcomes (see the suggested list of indicators in the Disability Inclusion Action Plan 20182023; GFDRR 2018a, 7). Data on both participation rates by persons with disabilities and on general improvements in accessibility (by removing physical, financial, informational, attitudinal, and institutional barriers) are needed to fully monitor and evaluate disability inclusion in DRM (ibid.; GFDRR 2020c, 21).", "sentences": [{"id": "64ba115781cff098342cd358a05713e45b1eba0fa322b451247dbb1acc13c4c2.PG62.PA3.S0",
