The WHO Global Network for Age-friendly Communities and Cities consists primarily of cities located in highand middle-income countries. As of 2018, Africa was not represented (WHO 2018). What can we say to those cities that have smaller proportions of older persons currently but whose trajectories of aging will accelerate in the coming decade? To them, we present here the idea of age-readiness, using evidence and examples from aging and aged economies to help them visualize an aging future and address the question: What makes a city age-ready?", "sentences": [{"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.S0", "text": "In 2007, the World Health Organization articulated the idea of age-friendly cities and became an exception to the general tendency of policy research on aging to focus primarily on the national level."}, {"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.S1", "text": "Two and a half decades later, WHOs guide to cities oriented toward older populations is still relevant as a how to for practitioners and for its contribution in laying out the key issues involved.2"}, {"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.S2", "text": "Our use of the term age-ready complements WHOs formulation of age-friendly cities."}, {"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.S3", "text": "The WHO Global Network for Age-friendly Communities and Cities consists primarily of cities located in highand middle-income countries."}, {"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.S4", "text": "As of 2018, Africa was not represented."}, {"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.S5", "text": "What can we say to those cities that have smaller proportions of older persons currently but whose trajectories of aging will accelerate in the coming decade?"}, {"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.S6", "text": "To them, we present here the idea of age-readiness, using evidence and examples from aging and aged economies to help them visualize an aging future and address the question: What makes a city age-ready?"}], "entities": [{"id": "5d7638d4b74cf48b6ea497aed6c211a63dcacd11ccfbda5c461aa4967938a597", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.ORG1", "text": "the World Health Organization", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "578200588b25417a552441dcbbd17b86c6a3de5c66c1ccf35ad942f851dc0e95", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.ORG3", "text": "WHOs", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "578200588b25417a552441dcbbd17b86c6a3de5c66c1ccf35ad942f851dc0e95", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.ORG4", "text": "WHOs", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.ORG5", "text": "WHO", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "3f5053b3ae70794bff96eb3501a85eedda4b3ee740c9207e6568df248a867c13", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG23.PA5.LOC7", "text": "Africa", "label": "LOC"}]}

A study of China, Mexico, Nigeria, and Peru has shown that between 63 and 89 percent of principal caregivers for older persons are women, the vast majority of them unpaid (Razavi 2017). As the aging population increases around the world, the demand for care work will continue to rise and, without active policy and programmatic intervention, the burden will continue to be borne by women and by immigrant workers. This will have significant negative consequences for caregivers well-being and their ability to participate equally in the paid workforce, leading to unequal economic outcomes and reinforcing gender inequality (ibid.).", "sentences": [{"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG43.PA4.S0", "text": "Finally, the burden of caring for others, including older persons, falls disproportionately on women, both before and after retirement, even if they do not live in skip-generation households."}, {"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG43.PA4.S1", "text": "A study of China, Mexico, Nigeria, and Peru has shown that between 63 and 89 percent of principal caregivers for older persons are women, the vast majority of them unpaid."}, {"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG43.PA4.S2", "text": "As the aging population increases around the world, the demand for care work will continue to rise and, without active policy and programmatic intervention, the burden will continue to be borne by women and by immigrant workers."}, {"id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG43.PA4.S3", "text": "This will have significant negative consequences for caregivers well-being and their ability to participate equally in the paid workforce, leading to unequal economic outcomes and reinforcing gender inequality."}], "entities": [{"id": "50c0152c2952082aeaf427885a2f617d67cf6de183a8816c0955ea5b875a216b", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG43.PA4.GPE0", "text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "8be2978e343799a3747a31957706009d207d6a3de7978e63f00b2a41cc99355f", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG43.PA4.GPE1", "text": "Mexico", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "3383e4237141bb9feeb2c9792f7b4eb248550a513ff231f698b6c617012ae7a2", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG43.PA4.GPE2", "text": "Nigeria", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "fdc224c5d688634467113c9ceba3a0aa86249018cba9c4fa0e5acc01ae1b688a", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG43.PA4.GPE3", "text": "Peru", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "de9feaea8b66f7ba74845ee5fc156cdd22e8e4533de13ca76d71ac495da358ff", "mention_id": "0f28440ed9f30b2a4e3f06823ac64bad300e4f1ffdf84f281a70234566f60a9b.PG43.PA4.PHRASE0", "text": "gender", "label": "PHRASE"}]}

Figure 3.1 illustrates that a city needs to be adaptive, productive, and inclusive in order to become age-ready. In being adaptive, a city transforms or repurposes some of its existing infrastructure to respond to the new challenge of aging. In Japan, for example, school buildings were repurposed into community centers as the number of schoolchildren declined and that of older persons increased. Such adaptation means incorporating universal accessibility and flexible design approaches, in some cases retrofitting, repurposing, and redesigning existing infrastructure, such as buildings, public spaces, and housing. Ideally, city infrastructure will be built better before, incorporating design that benefits all its residents. But when that is not possible, cities will need to take advantage of renovations and repairs to insert universal design features to build back better.
