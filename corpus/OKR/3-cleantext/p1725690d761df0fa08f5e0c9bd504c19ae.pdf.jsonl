Four key challenges include: reducing or avoiding GHG emissions, decarbonizing local economies, managing physical risk from extreme climate events, and adapting to the slow-onset environmental impacts of climate change. It must be recognized, however, that these challenges are related and have some common policy solutions.  Reducing or Avoiding Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Growth in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and other heat-trapping gases like methane and nitrous oxide are driving global warming, and the last 10 years were the hottest on record.1 Globally, total GHG emissions increased 1.5 percent per year from 2009 to 2018, reaching 2.0 percent in 2018. For consistency with sustainable development pathways that stabilize warming levels at 2.0C, GHG emissions must fall 7.6 percent annually until 2030. Such drastic reductions remain far out of reach under the Paris Agreements initial national commitments, as the current rate is projected to lead to a 3.2C warming by the end of the century.  Decarbonizing Local Economies. Accelerating the transition to net zero carbon emissions is needed to halt global warming, avoid the socioeconomic and environmental risks linked to fossil fuelbased development, and create job opportunities in the 21st century energy transition. Lowcarbon economies would rely on renewable power resources with very low fossil carbon in key sectors, for example, electricity, industry, buildings, and transport. Transition to low, or net zero, carbon economies poses challenges that require active management, such as sequencing policy changes and investments backwards from mid-century net zero targets. As action grows more stringent over time, making regular progress against targets has major consequences for the near-term investment decisions needed to avoid lock-in to carbon intensive infrastructure and associated financial risks from stranded assets.  Managing Physical Risks from Extreme ClimateRelated Hazards. Physical disaster risk is a product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability in a specific time and place. Certain locations are inherently risky, for example, dense neighborhoods with housing and commercial activities on steep slopes. Physical risks arise from a mix of factors, such as population growth, land use and economic development patterns, and GHG accumulation in the atmosphere, increasing the variability and intensity of extreme weather events. These changes increase extreme flooding, wind intensities in tropical storms, and wildfires from longer and hotter droughts that cause physical damage. The variability and intensity of climate hazards and physical destruction and monetary losses will rise under a 2.0C mean global temperature increase compared to 1.5C. Recent modeling exercises indicate that regions in some countries could experience up to six climate hazards a year without aggressive emission reductions.  Adapting to Slow Onset Environmental Change. Slow onset environmental change requires urgent reductions in the intensity of natural resource use and improvements in adaptive capacity to cope with threats to human prosperity and development. These latter include water scarcity, desertification, infectious diseases, and biodiversity decline. Permanent changes in agricultural zones, extreme surface heat, and sea-level rise are three threats from slow onset environmental change, each of which could make some areas uninhabitable in the next 30 years. Certain types of slow onset change, such as ecosystem degradation and desertification, reduce the productivity of land and ocean carbon sinks that sequester half of human-caused emissions. Feedback effects between climate systems suggests that slow onset environmental change is nonlinear and unpredictable over different time scales. Crossing tipping points could enhance negative feedback effects that spiral beyond the coping capacity of governments, spilling over subnational and national borders and causing widespread damages and losses.", "raw_text": "Decarbonization and adaptation are two umbrella objectives that cover other challenges addressed through climate policy. Four key challenges include: reducing or avoiding GHG emissions, decarbonizing local economies, managing physical risk from extreme climate events, and adapting to the slow-onset environmental impacts of climate change. It must be recognized, however, that these challenges are related and have some common policy solutions.  Reducing or Avoiding Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Growth in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and other heat-trapping gases like methane and nitrous oxide are driving global warming, and the last 10 years were the hottest on record.1 Globally, total GHG emissions increased 1.5 percent per year from 2009 to 2018, reaching 2.0 percent in 2018 (UNEP 2019). For consistency with sustainable development pathways that stabilize warming levels at 2.0C, GHG emissions must fall 7.6 percent annually until 2030. Such drastic reductions remain far out of reach under the Paris Agreements initial national commitments, as the current rate is projected to lead to a 3.2C warming by the end of the century (UNEP 2020).  Decarbonizing Local Economies. Accelerating the transition to net zero carbon emissions is needed to halt global warming, avoid the socioeconomic and environmental risks linked to fossil fuelbased development, and create job opportunities in the 21st century energy transition (Bazaz et al. 2018). Lowcarbon economies would rely on renewable power resources with very low fossil carbon in key sectors, for example, electricity, industry, buildings, and transport (LEED and EC 2015). Transition to low, or net zero, carbon economies poses challenges that require active management, such as sequencing policy changes and investments backwards from mid-century net zero targets. As action grows more stringent over time, making regular progress against targets has major consequences for the near-term investment decisions needed to avoid lock-in to carbon intensive infrastructure and associated financial risks from stranded assets.  Managing Physical Risks from Extreme ClimateRelated Hazards. Physical disaster risk is a product of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability in a specific time and place. Certain locations are inherently risky, for example, dense neighborhoods with housing and commercial activities on steep slopes. Physical risks arise from a mix of factors, such as population growth, land use and economic development patterns, and GHG accumulation in the atmosphere, increasing the variability and intensity of extreme weather events. These changes increase extreme flooding, wind intensities in tropical storms, and wildfires from longer and hotter droughts that cause physical damage (Mirza 2003; Stott 2016). The variability and intensity of climate hazards and physical destruction and monetary losses will rise under a 2.0C mean global temperature increase compared to 1.5C (IPCC 2018). Recent modeling exercises indicate that regions in some countries could experience up to six climate hazards a year without aggressive emission reductions (Mora et al. 2018).  Adapting to Slow Onset Environmental Change. Slow onset environmental change requires urgent reductions in the intensity of natural resource use and improvements in adaptive capacity to cope with threats to human prosperity and development. These latter include water scarcity, desertification, infectious diseases, and biodiversity decline. Permanent changes in agricultural zones, extreme surface heat, and sea-level rise are three threats from slow onset environmental change, each of which could make some areas uninhabitable in the next 30 years (Hassell et al. 2017; Kang and Eltahir 2018). Certain types of slow onset change, such as ecosystem degradation and desertification, reduce the productivity of land and ocean carbon sinks that sequester half of human-caused emissions. Feedback effects between climate systems suggests that slow onset environmental change is nonlinear and unpredictable over different time scales (Friedlingstein et al. 2019). Crossing tipping points could enhance negative feedback effects that spiral beyond the coping capacity of governments, spilling over subnational and national borders and causing widespread damages and losses.", "sentences": [{"id": "38e280693e1dae789def077c7828ea77c2fdd5a4e434520844f1d75f38b4ed36.PG10.PA2.S0", "text": "Decarbonization and adaptation are two umbrella objectives that cover other
