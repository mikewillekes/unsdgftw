If all cities had the same level of efficiency, welfare would increase by 47 percent. If all cities had the same level of amenities, welfare would increase by 13 percent. However, the exercise is entirely about reallocation among cities, not to lagging regions.

As chapter 3 shows, migration is not so fluid as to eliminate differences in unemployment rates or wage gaps among regions; hence, creating new jobs in a depressed region has social value. Reallocating labor can lead to a net social benefit if there is some market failure or barrier that prohibits equalization of marginal productivity in two sectors.
