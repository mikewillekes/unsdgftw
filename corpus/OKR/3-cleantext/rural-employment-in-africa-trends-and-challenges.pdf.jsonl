The early literature on job quality conceptualizes decent work through a focus on workers own evaluation of their job and their job satisfaction (Burchell et al., 2014). More recent studies use composite, multidimensional indices to quantify job quality, such as Yu (2020),12 who documents that employment quality in South Africa is higher in urban than in rural areas, lower in agriculture than in other sectors, higher in formal than in informal sector employment, and increasing with age and education.
