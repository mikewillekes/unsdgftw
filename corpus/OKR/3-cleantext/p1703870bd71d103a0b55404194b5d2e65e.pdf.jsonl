Address the lack of information on water points by strengthening the quality and frequency of their monitoring. The functionality of water points in the South of Angola is severely hampered by a lack of adequate information on the status of water infrastructure and water resources. Establish mechanisms to update information, and to manage it, share it, and use it. Operationalize the Sistema de Informacao do Sector de Agua e Saneamento by connecting it to systematic reporting from the field administrations, as well as to repair and maintenance actions. Improve infrastructure planning and design by investing in water resources knowledgegroundwater studies, surface water and water balance studiesand continuous monitoring mechanisms. Involve universities and share data.  Invest in community-level infrastructure. Implement an integrated program of physical investments to develop and mobilize water resources reliably and sustainably for and with rural communities. These investments can include large diameter wells, boreholes with solar pumps, storage tanks, drinking taps and basins for cattle, boreholes with a small desal unit in key locations, deep boreholes, runoff harvesting sand dams, chimpacas and cisterns, bulk water through piped supply, old weirs and small dam rehabilitation, managed aquifer recharge, and watershed storage. Make decisions based on data and studies. Continuously update the prioritization of vulnerable communes based on the nature of ongoing investments and interventions from partners.  Resilience means having more than one option. It is essential to plan for redundancies and buffers in the form of storage. Plan with a regional strategic view, focusing on communities but also on transhumance corridors.  Invest in people and institutions. Investments and resources are needed to guarantee minimal levels of institutional capacity at all levels, to ensure water security in the region and systematically maintain water supply systems. It is essential to build institutional preparedness and capacity to reduce drought impacts in the form of devastated livelihoods, lives lost, and stunted children. Strengthen and scale up community-level organizations and regional water point governance.

Address the lack of information on water points by strengthening the quality and frequency of their monitoring. The functionality of water points in the South of Angola is severely hampered by a lack of adequate information on the status of water infrastructure and water resources. Establish mechanisms to update information, and to manage it, share it, and use it. Operationalize the Sistema de Informacao do Sector de Agua e Saneamento (SISAS) by connecting it to systematic reporting from the field administrations, as well as to repair and maintenance actions. Improve infrastructure planning and design by investing in water resources knowledgegroundwater studies, surface water and water balance studiesand continuous monitoring mechanisms. Involve universities and share data.  Invest in community-level infrastructure. Implement an integrated program of physical investments to develop and mobilize water resources reliably and sustainably for and with rural communities. These investments can include large diameter wells, boreholes with solar pumps, storage tanks, drinking taps and basins for cattle, boreholes with a small desal unit in key locations, deep boreholes, runoff harvesting sand dams, chimpacas and cisterns, bulk water through piped supply, old weirs and small dam rehabilitation, managed aquifer recharge, and watershed storage. Make decisions based on data and studies. Continuously update the prioritization of vulnerable communes based on the nature of ongoing investments and interventions from partners.  Resilience means having more than one option. It is essential to plan for redundancies and buffers in the form of storage. Plan with a regional strategic view, focusing on communities but also on transhumance corridors.  Invest in people and institutions. Investments and resources are needed to guarantee minimal levels of institutional capacity at all levels, to ensure water security in the region and systematically maintain water supply systems. It is essential to build institutional preparedness and capacity to reduce drought impacts in the form of devastated livelihoods, lives lost, and stunted children.

Groundwater presence across the South of Angola is variable, and in many parts current knowledge on groundwater dynamics is inadequate. The yield of small-diameter wells with PVC casing and a solar pump typically fluctuates between 5 m3/day and 20 m3/day. c. Boreholes with a small desal unit where brackish groundwater is present and alternative resources are scarce: For dispersed and remote communities far from the main water pipes and not easily accessible by road, treatment of mineralized groundwater could be a solution for drinking water supply. The use of compact solar-powered small desalination units of brackish groundwater can be a reliable and cost-effective alternative in certain settings. It is important to accompany the construction of desal units with adequate financial and technical management arrangements, considering that operation and maintenance is what normally threatens desalination units. Operators conducting O&M shall be identified and the spare parts supply chain needs to be planned. d. Deep boreholes: From the Namibian side of the border the presence of regional aquifers at greater depth has been confirmed. The presence and potential of deep aquifers in South Angola has yet to be confirmed but if confirmed, deep wells could be a strategic resource in view of the long-term water security of South Angola, providing secure water points for the region around them. Well depths will depend on the geometry and dynamics of the aquifers but would vary between 200 m and 400 m. Drilling and O&M costs are higher for large diameter deep wells, and adequate governance arrangements need to be put in place. Yields of some of the deep wells in the Namibian part of the Cuvelai basin exceed 100 m3/hr. e. Sand dams in areas with ephemeral streams but very small shallow aquifers: The typical sand dam is constructed where a stream has excavated its course in an impervious basement, such as a crystalline basement or a clayey formation or marls, and the rock is exposed. The dam is expected to be filled by sediments carried by the stream flow. As soon as a partial filling occurs, the sediments are saturated by water at each flow and can be tapped through shallow wells. Normally a dam of this type is 25 m high and less than 200 m wide.

Improved chimpacas: Direct harvesting of surface water in areas with limited or no groundwater potential. Chimpacas, excavated rectangular large pits in the very flat landscapes of Cunene, trap runoff water during the rainy season. Typically, mechanically excavated chimpacas store about 20,000 m3 of water per season but their design will be adjusted to water demand, surface water potential, and purpose.

Groundwater presence across the South of Angola is variable, and in many parts current knowledge on groundwater dynamics is inadequate. The yield of small-diameter wells with PVC casing and a solar pump typically fluctuates between 5 m3/day and 20 m3/day. c. Boreholes with a small desal unit where brackish groundwater is present and alternative resources are scarce: For dispersed and remote communities far from the main water pipes and not easily accessible by road, treatment of mineralized groundwater could be a solution for drinking water supply. The use of compact solar-powered small desalination units of brackish groundwater can be a reliable and cost-effective alternative in certain settings. It is important to accompany the construction of desal units with adequate financial and technical management arrangements, considering that operation and maintenance (O&M) is what normally threatens desalination units. Operators conducting O&M shall be identified and the spare parts supply chain needs to be planned. d. Deep boreholes (more than 200 m depth): From the Namibian side of the border the presence of regional aquifers at greater depth has been confirmed. The presence and potential of deep aquifers in South Angola has yet to be confirmed but if confirmed, deep wells could be a strategic resource in view of the long-term water security of South Angola, providing secure water points for the region around them. Well depths will depend on the geometry and dynamics of the aquifers but would vary between 200 m and 400 m. Drilling and O&M costs are higher for large diameter deep wells, and adequate governance arrangements need to be put in place. Yields of some of the deep wells in the Namibian part of the Cuvelai basin exceed 100 m3/hr. e. Sand dams in areas with ephemeral streams but very small shallow aquifers: The typical sand dam is constructed where a stream has excavated its course in an impervious basement, such as a crystalline basement or a clayey formation or marls, and the rock is exposed. The dam is expected to be filled by sediments (normally sand) carried by the stream flow. As soon as a partial filling occurs, the sediments are saturated by water at each flow and can be tapped through shallow wells. Normally a dam of this type is 25 m high and less than 200 m wide. Depending on the flow regime, the geology/morphology and the water needs, other types of water harvesting and managed aquifer recharge (MAR) structures can be built, including check dams or spreading sills. f.
