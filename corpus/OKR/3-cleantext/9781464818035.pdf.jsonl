We ask how our sample countries fare on five performance indicators of this transition: investment in human capital; marriage and FLFP; lifetime FLFP; gender earnings gaps; and distribution of employment across industries and occupations. The results show that, for most women, the transition from jobs to careers is still quite limited, suggesting the presence of significant barriers.

We identify and explore three barriers to the transition: low demand for professional service industries; low education levels; and societal and cultural norms that inhibit or dissuade women from working. The main results show that in some LMICs, limited demand for HSOs, combined with below-average female participation in mid-skill industries, are profound constraints that limit the opportunities for women beyond apparel production.  Chapter 4: How Does an Apparel Export Strategy Fit into the Jobs-to-Careers Transition? We examine how apparel exports can contribute to the jobs-to-careers transition, focusing on how exporting apparel intersects with the three barriers. The main results are that the HSOs associated with careers are limited in manufacturing and that it is difficult for female apparel workers to move into other HSOs.
