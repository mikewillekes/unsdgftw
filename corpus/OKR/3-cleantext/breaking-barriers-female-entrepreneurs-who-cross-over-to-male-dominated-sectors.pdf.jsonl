The gender gap in profits may also be partly explained by the fact that women tend to run smaller firms than men (Hallward-Driemeier 2013; Carranza, Dhakal, and Love 2018; Buvinic, Knowles, and Witoelar 2018).", "sentences": [{"id": "213c837a93ae697f9a285da6ec6048499ef6591accd1146bc6010d41cd3ac32a.PG16.PA28.S0", "text": "W omen make up a greater share of entrepreneurs worldwide than ever before."}, {"id": "213c837a93ae697f9a285da6ec6048499ef6591accd1146bc6010d41cd3ac32a.PG16.PA28.S1", "text": "Globally the gaps in the ratio of female to male participation in entrepreneurial activity are shrinking, and in some countries, women are as or more likely than men to own a business.3"}, {"id": "213c837a93ae697f9a285da6ec6048499ef6591accd1146bc6010d41cd3ac32a.PG16.PA28.S2", "text": "Womens greater participation, however, does not mean that they are benefiting equally."}, {"id": "213c837a93ae697f9a285da6ec6048499ef6591accd1146bc6010d41cd3ac32a.PG16.PA28.S3", "text": "Profits and sales of female entrepreneurs continue to be lower on average than those of male entrepreneurs and their businesses have higher closure rates and less potential for growth."}, {"id": "213c837a93ae697f9a285da6ec6048499ef6591accd1146bc6010d41cd3ac32a.PG16.PA28.S4", "text": "The gender gap in profits may also be partly explained by the fact that women tend to run smaller firms than men."}], "entities": [{"id": "de9feaea8b66f7ba74845ee5fc156cdd22e8e4533de13ca76d71ac495da358ff", "mention_id": "213c837a93ae697f9a285da6ec6048499ef6591accd1146bc6010d41cd3ac32a.PG16.PA28.PHRASE0", "text": "gender", "label": "PHRASE"}]}

While it was not associated with crossing over in Ethiopia in the full sample, the top 25 percent of earners among crossovers were more likely to report having a male role model while growing up. The FoB study finds that having a male role model is significantly associated with crossing over in pooled data from all 97 countries. Additional analyses highlight the various pathways through which role models may be associated with crossing over. In the subset of developing countries, the association between having a role model and crossing over disappears when noncognitive skills such as generalized self-efficacy, career-fit confidence, and entrepreneurial identity are accounted for. In Uganda, the association between role models and crossing over disappears when exposure to the sector is accounted for. These analyses highlight the various pathways through which mentors and role models influence women to cross over to male-dominated sectors and are reminiscent of the pathways through which marital status may be associated with crossing over in the developed country analysis in the FoB study and in Ethiopia. For example, role models could be providing exposure through suggesting or offering jobs in these male-dominated sectors, providing introductions and networks information, and generally boosting womens confidence about their fit and other noncognitive skills that help women operate in and select maledominated sectors. The study in Uganda attempts to unpack the role of role models and finds that crossovers are likely to be introduced to their sectors by men, including fathers, male friends, male community members, and male family members. The influence of these role models is not limited to owning an enterprise in that sector but exists above and beyond that. Qualitative research in Uganda finds that male role models and mentors help by providing training to gain skills specific to male-dominated sectors or coming up with the idea for the business. Relatedly, a study of vocational training applicants in the Republic of Congo emphasizes both the importance of exposure to MDS and womens disadvantaged access to early exposure. The research finds that prior technical experience in MDS makes it more likely that women will opt for training in MDS. However, women are less likely to have network connections with people operating businesses in MDS, and men are more likely than women to obtain technical experience through their network connections.

In Ethiopia, for example, the association between education and crossing over may be captured through indicators of cognitive ability, as this association disappears when Digit Span Test scores are accounted for. Furthermore, given the positive association between education and wealth, the greater average profits observed in the MDS could also be driven by these more educated entrepreneurs clustering in these sectors.  Self-efficacy: Self-efficacy as per Albert Bandura is the belief in ones own capability to execute a task, perform a behavior, or achieve an outcome. A persons self-efficacy is considered to be a function of performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, interpretation of ones emotional arousal or physiological state that collectively determine these beliefs. The belief in ones ability to achieve an outcome in turn drives perseverance, which could be an important skill needed to cross over. The association between self-efficacy and crossing over is not consistent across settings in this report. In Ethiopia, Mexico, and the multicountry FoB study among developing countries, no association is observed between self-efficacy and crossing over. However, a positive association is seen in developed countries in the multicountry FoB study and in some regression specifications in Uganda. For example, after accounting for exposureenabling factors in Uganda, self-efficacy is no longer associated with crossing over. This may be explained by a key factor that drives self-efficacy: verbal persuasion. Exposureenabling factors such as persuasion or suggesting to someone that they possess the skills to cross over can positively reinforce self-efficacy. Therefore, it is likely that the perception that others believe you to succeed in male-dominated fields drives both self-efficacy and crossing over. For example, Barnir, Watson, and Hutchins find that role models have a strong influence on selfefficacy, which, in turn, influences entrepreneurial career intention. Needing greater self-efficacy to operate as a crossover is another factor that emerged in the qualitative component of the study. Among women working in MDS in Conakry, Guinea, women talked about having to prove themselves as capable. For example, a woman painter said, You have to work hard to show those people that even if you have work at home, you have children, you have your husband, you can also work like men do. This suggests that women may need a high degree of self-efficacy to be able to persevere in work environments dominated by men where they can face regular questions about their competence and commitment to the work. On the other hand, performance accomplishments can drive self-efficacy and we find that some of the women who managed to succeed in MDS reported increased self-confidence and pride due to their success.

Decision-making: In Guinea, crossovers are likely to have greater decision-making power within the home. However, in Botswana, a negative association is seen between a higher score on a household decision-making index and crossing over. This is possibly due to what this index captures. For example, it is possible that women who cross over, especially at the scale that MDS operate at in Botswana, do not partake in daily decision-making around households tasks compared to women who remain in FCS. Those who do participate in household decision-making are the women who are less likely to operate a business in MDS.

On the other hand, when asked specifically about decision-making in terms of their business, the crossovers in Botswana report a greater ability to participate in such decisions compared to noncrossovers.  Cognitive ability: No clear or consistent association is seen between crossing over and cognitive ability. Cognitive ability was measured across the studies in this report primarily in two ways. One was using the Ravens Progressive Matrices, an assessment of analytical or fluid intelligence and abstract thinking, and another was the Digit Span Test, an assessment of short-term working memory.

The study also finds that women who cross over after seeing the video had already overcome some barriers: women were at least three times more likely to cross over when seeing the video if they had higher technical experience, higher technical knowledge, or a male role model.
