These reforms fall short in fostering an environment for gender equality in forestry. In 2014, President Joko Widodo announced a forest tenure program called Perhutanan Sosial (Social Forestry), intended to improve the well-being of people with forest based livelihoods and to protect forests through sustainable management (Wahyuningsih 2018). Through the social forestry scheme, local communities have the ability to obtain forest management licenses, granting them the right to use and manage a particular forest area for 35 years. In their current design, Indonesias social forestry schemes do not confer full land ownership to communities, although communities are pressing for full land ownership rights (Banjade et al. 2016). Although the management license is granted to the community as a whole, these access rights are then distributed within the community through heads of households. Female-headed households, such as those where the wife is a divorcee or the husband has migrated for work, can be disadvantaged in this process (Wahyuningsih 2018). As a forest tenure reform strategy, the FAO has noted that participatory policies [like social forestry] presume communities to be homogeneous social entities with common interests and priorities; they do not consider that they comprise different groups with disparate genders... levels of power and access to resources (FAO 2015).", "sentences": [{"id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.S0", "text": "Forest tenure reforms in Indonesia are under way in an attempt to clarify the tenure regime and provide more benefit to Indigenous and forestbased communities."}, {"id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.S1", "text": "These reforms fall short in fostering an environment for gender equality in forestry."}, {"id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.S2", "text": "In 2014, President Joko Widodo announced a forest tenure program called Perhutanan Sosial, intended to improve the well-being of people with forest based livelihoods and to protect forests through sustainable management."}, {"id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.S3", "text": "Through the social forestry scheme, local communities have the ability to obtain forest management licenses, granting them the right to use and manage a particular forest area for 35 years."}, {"id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.S4", "text": "In their current design, Indonesias social forestry schemes do not confer full land ownership to communities, although communities are pressing for full land ownership rights."}, {"id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.S5", "text": "Although the management license is granted to the community as a whole, these access rights are then distributed within the community through heads of households."}, {"id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.S6", "text": "Female-headed households, such as those where the wife is a divorcee or the husband has migrated for work, can be disadvantaged in this process."}, {"id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.S7", "text": "As a forest tenure reform strategy, the FAO has noted that participatory policies presume communities to be homogeneous social entities with common interests and priorities; they do not consider that they comprise different groups with disparate genders... levels of power and access to resources."}], "entities": [{"id": "341cf9022a3e6469098ed7a7d056071f73087d283407c3b108c6e0fd8996ef3c", "mention_id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.GPE0", "text": "Indonesia", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "2f6caccb363435739c40771e38dd94282dcba4fd917734260364ca1b2a4da00c", "mention_id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.NORP1", "text": "Indigenous", "label": "NORP"}, {"id": "5be23205b959e11cc94f3b358e5edf22615c2cab7790125dc026edeb28aebf31", "mention_id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.PERSON3", "text": "Joko Widodo", "label": "PERSON"}, {"id": "90883a35d20451e47244a5fc4a63bbdca09bf54a53893e66e2d73466f2dc6acc", "mention_id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.ORG4", "text": "Perhutanan Sosial", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "77140ca94d3b3e3ca6bdd4f185d722c719c1f37dfb8662fa2f6765cf30319d50", "mention_id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.NORP6", "text": "Indonesias", "label": "NORP"}, {"id": "697031e3ca304f09681922119125a6522807e196743a89c7cda4110408cac2ef", "mention_id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.ORG7", "text": "FAO", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "de9feaea8b66f7ba74845ee5fc156cdd22e8e4533de13ca76d71ac495da358ff", "mention_id": "e9b25387fade64fb4f17be1cb31a23d316f727bbd7cfd178031b7b9c7d39e7ed.PG4.PA3.PHRASE0", "text": "gender", "label": "PHRASE"}]}
