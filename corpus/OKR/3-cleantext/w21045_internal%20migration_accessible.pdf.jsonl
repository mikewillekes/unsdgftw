Migration is identified when an individual changed a place of usual residence one, five or ten years ago to a new major administrative unit in the same country.

Williams 2009). Empirical studies show that the direction of migrant selectivity by educational level differs across countries (Cattaneo 2007; Gould 1982). Previous studies at the individual level provide inconsistent evidence on the relationship between education and the propensity to migrate. On the one hand, a series of studies report a positive effect of educational attainment on the likelihood of internal migration both for males (Agesa and Agesa 1999; Chae and Glick 2019) and females (Brockerhoff and Eu 1993; Chae and Glick 2019). On the other hand, many studies find a negative relationship between education and migration (Massey et al. 1987; Massey and Espinosa 1997; Quinn and Rubb 2005; Reed et al. 2010) and some studies reported no significant association at all (Adams 1993; Curran and Rivero-Fuentes 2003). Whether highly educated individuals are more or less likely to migrate following climatic shocks also depends on their adaptive capacity and adaptation options available. Whilst human capital enables in situ adaptation, it also facilitates migration. Education differentials in vulnerability and adaptive capacity may explain the heterogeneity in the effect of education on migration.", "sentences": [{"id": "c7cd714e05e44242b935e71bbb2bfbf61f940feb4374ece450c9f9eae82a9911.PG9.PA1.S0", "text": "6 Climatic shocks and internal migration educated individuals."}, {"id": "c7cd714e05e44242b935e71bbb2bfbf61f940feb4374ece450c9f9eae82a9911.PG9.PA1.S1", "text": "Empirical studies show that the direction of migrant selectivity by educational level differs across countries."}, {"id": "c7cd714e05e44242b935e71bbb2bfbf61f940feb4374ece450c9f9eae82a9911.PG9.PA1.S2", "text": "Previous studies at the individual level provide inconsistent evidence on the relationship between education and the propensity to migrate."}, {"id": "c7cd714e05e44242b935e71bbb2bfbf61f940feb4374ece450c9f9eae82a9911.PG9.PA1.S3", "text": "On the one hand, a series of studies report a positive effect of educational attainment on the likelihood of internal migration both for males and females."}, {"id": "c7cd714e05e44242b935e71bbb2bfbf61f940feb4374ece450c9f9eae82a9911.PG9.PA1.S4", "text": "On the other hand, many studies find a negative relationship between education and migration and some studies reported no significant association at all."}, {"id": "c7cd714e05e44242b935e71bbb2bfbf61f940feb4374ece450c9f9eae82a9911.PG9.PA1.S5", "text": "Whether highly educated individuals are more or less likely to migrate following climatic shocks also depends on their adaptive capacity and adaptation options available."}, {"id": "c7cd714e05e44242b935e71bbb2bfbf61f940feb4374ece450c9f9eae82a9911.PG9.PA1.S6", "text": "Whilst human capital enables in situ adaptation, it also facilitates migration."}, {"id": "c7cd714e05e44242b935e71bbb2bfbf61f940feb4374ece450c9f9eae82a9911.PG9.PA1.S7", "text": "Education differentials in vulnerability and adaptive capacity may explain the heterogeneity in the effect of education on migration."}], "entities": []}
