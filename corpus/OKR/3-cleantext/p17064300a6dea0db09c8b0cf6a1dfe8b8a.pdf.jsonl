Support xx REPURPOSING AGRICULTURAL POLICIES AND SUPPORT that is, technologies and practices that would reduce emissions while increasing productivity. Recognizing that achieving this is not without cost, the focus of this scenario is on redirecting some of the domestic support currently provided to agriculture toward more public spending on research and development, and incentives for the development and adoption of green innovations. Some such innovations already exist or are emerging. Based on an examination of the literature on the potential of recent innovations to raise productivity and reduce agricultural emissions, this illustrative scenario assumes a 30 percent increase in production and a 30 percent reduction in emissions per unit of output. The literature on past agricultural productivity growth suggests that the cost of raising agricultural productivity by 30 percent on a sustainable basis would be roughly equivalent to one percent of the value of farm output. This scenario considers repurposing the equivalent of one percent of the value of farm output from the current domestic support for agriculture to invest in R&D, under the assumption that with reoriented R&D priorities, this level of research intensity would also apply to the generation of green innovations. The remaining domestic support would amount to a saving for taxpayers and would be potentially available to deliver as nondistorting transfers to producers and other stakeholders to compensate them for any losses they might incur due to this reform, and for spending on extension services, rural infrastructure, and other essential public goods and services that are fostering agricultural and rural development. The importance of green innovations in delivering these wins is clear from Figure O.5, which shows the results of the repurposing scenario.  Global real income would be higher, reflecting large economic efficiency gains. In 2040, the projected world income would be 1.6 percent higher than the business-as-usual projection.  Adoption of these improved technologies would deliver huge benefits for the climate and nature. Between 2020 and 2040, overall emissions from agriculture would fall by more than 40 percent, or nearly 2.8 Gt CO2eqavoiding nearly 80 percent of the incremental emissions expected under the baseline scenario. Productivity growth would also release production factors, including land. About 2.2 percent less agricultural land would be needed in this scenario, releasing about 105 million hectares of agricultural land for restoration to natural habitats, with potentially substantial biodiversity benefits. This approach would spare not only the additional 56 million hectares of land that would be transferred to agriculture between 2020 and 2040 under the baseline scenario but would also release another 48 million hectares currently being used for agriculture that could be restored as natural habitats. xxi Overview  Productivity-driven growth reduces poverty and makes nutritionally adequate diets more affordable. In this scenario, global extreme poverty would fall by 1 percent, while the cost of a healthy diet would drop by a substantial 18 percent.  Incomes of farm workers would increase, while farm employment would fall as part of structural economic transformation over the long termbetween now and 2040. The repurposing of current agricultural support could facilitate farm labor moving into other parts of the economy, because some of this money could be spent instead on human capital and skills development, as well as on rural financing and infrastructure.

Briefly, these include simultaneous actions on both the supply and demand sides of the innovation puzzle. On the supply side, the priority is to increase investment in R&D. This would require (1) increasing publicly supported R&D for invention, adaptation, and dissemination of new technologies (for example, by increasing, stabilizing, and diversifying funding; incentivizing scientists and strengthening universities and public research institutions; aligning priorities with user needs; and partnering with foreign and international researchers); and (2) mobilizing the private sector to invest in research and innovation through market liberalization; regulatory reform; intellectual property rights; and catalytic and complementary public R&D.
