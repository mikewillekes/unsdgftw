LAC is one of the most waterrich regions in the world, accounting for 15 percent of global land area, 10 percent of world population and 29 percent of the planets precipitation. LAC countries receive an average annual precipitation of 1,780 millimeters (mm), which is approximately two-to-three times the precipitation of the United States (715 mm) or China (645 mm). Consequently, water availability per person in LAC is 21,300 cubic meter per person per year (m3/person/year, four times the worlds average (5,700 m3/person/year) and more than 10 times the threshold considered for water stress (1,700 m3/person/year) (Figure 8).", "sentences": [{"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.S1", "text": "The large benefits from water previously illustrated could not have been achieved without LAC s great water endowment."}, {"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.S2", "text": "LAC is one of the most waterrich regions in the world, accounting for 15 percent of global land area, 10 percent of world population and 29 percent of the planets precipitation."}, {"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.S3", "text": "LAC countries receive an average annual precipitation of 1,780 millimeters, which is approximately two-to-three times the precipitation of the United States or China."}, {"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.S4", "text": "Consequently, water availability per person in LAC is 21,300 cubic meter per person per year (m3/person/year, four times the worlds average and more than 10 times the threshold considered for water stress."}], "entities": [{"id": "a40d4e73cd6a4ddc99f4c6a425196629c82ce3eac00e3740ee94811eb629a93a", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.LOC1", "text": "LAC", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "a40d4e73cd6a4ddc99f4c6a425196629c82ce3eac00e3740ee94811eb629a93a", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.LOC2", "text": "LAC", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "a40d4e73cd6a4ddc99f4c6a425196629c82ce3eac00e3740ee94811eb629a93a", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.LOC7", "text": "LAC", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "981e5b396726008318fcca73b116e69d1680fdbe17a7fb078d10197731f1e700", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.GPE10", "text": "the United States", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "50c0152c2952082aeaf427885a2f617d67cf6de183a8816c0955ea5b875a216b", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.GPE11", "text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "a40d4e73cd6a4ddc99f4c6a425196629c82ce3eac00e3740ee94811eb629a93a", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG32.PA7.LOC12", "text": "LAC", "label": "LOC"}]}

Recent research (Borja Reguero 2015) estimates that with both extreme sea levels rising and populations increasing, exposure to 100year flood events in LAC will increase from todays 7.5 million inhabitants to 8.8 million by mid-century, with this number being closer to 9.9 million inhabitants living along the coasts, if historical trends in storm activity are included. When contributions from ENSO phenomena are also added, there is an increase of flood risks in the Pacific coast countries of the region (mainly Peru and Ecuador), and the likelihood of them happening sooner than previously anticipated. -600 -400 -200 0 200 400 600 -1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000", "sentences": [{"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG62.PA7.S0", "text": "83.

In Argentina, for instance, the rise of the water table in areas of the Pampean plains is not only related to the increase in rainfall but also to changes in land use (from pastures and perennial crops to annual crops) and production systems. The increase in the water table restricts infiltration and increases runoff and floods. In Tartagal, in Northern Argentina, a combination of intense rainfall and soil degradation also led to massive floods and landslides.52", "sentences": [{"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.S1", "text": "These challenges are not exclusive to urban areas."}, {"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.S2", "text": "Land use changes in rural areas also affect the incidence of floods."}, {"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.S3", "text": "Deforestation or inadequate agricultural practices can change the local water dynamics in a basin."}, {"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.S4", "text": "In Argentina, for instance, the rise of the water table in areas of the Pampean plains is not only related to the increase in rainfall but also to changes in land use and production systems."}, {"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.S5", "text": "The increase in the water table restricts infiltration and increases runoff and floods."}, {"id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.S6", "text": "In Tartagal, in Northern Argentina, a combination of intense rainfall and soil degradation also led to massive floods and landslides.52"}], "entities": [{"id": "3a73954246460ddeee5ccf594676cfd40c986dc4878104b181b20ff0b8ff58a1", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.GPE1", "text": "Argentina", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "71ea126bd7e5208153cd3a239bf267144387f14d236684876409614a9669e6ac", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.LOC2", "text": "Pampean", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "68c4ab0574e61a2888ed65c55dfbc3f27d188a47e860d9c6dbbe62960d35350f", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.GPE3", "text": "Tartagal", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "c0aa6708062edd2adc89e02679a65cd69e807e20ce7efc32f1c959259aba341a", "mention_id": "be29d89067df93cec4f9a97d9b86efd02af7854d9142810135e1bc87ec872787.PG94.PA4.LOC4", "text": "Northern Argentina", "label": "LOC"}]}
