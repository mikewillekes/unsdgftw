As with the case of perfect targeting, both the Middle East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa experience most of the gains in the early years of adoption. But in the case of adoption by all firms (not only those with positive marginal effects), the magnitude of the cumulative productivity gains in the early years is much lower than with perfect targeting, since the low gains in revenue productivity from the initially low-profit exporting firms partially offset the higher gains in profitability from the initially low-profit domestic firms. As time goes by, high-productivity firms are targeted and incorporated in the analysis.
