Detention of good is a tool that signifies the prevalence of random enforcement action. The effect of detainment can cause delays  raise costs, and uncertainty for cross-border traders and create opportunities for extraction of speed money to facilitate release of the goods. The best practice is for customs to promptly inform traders that goods have been detained for inspection.  More men customs brokers and slightly more men traders have had goods detained without being promptly informed. Eighty-one percent of women and 79 percent of men-led trade firms stated that their goods had never been detained, while 14 percent of women and 15 percent of men trade firms have had their goods detained. For customs brokers, 23 percent of men customs brokers report detention of goods without being promptly informed compared to only 13 percent of women customs brokers.  Many trade firms and customs brokers that have had their goods detained reported that their goods are detained less than half the time. However, about 38 percent of the men traders have had their goods detained every time compared to 28 percent of women traders.
