Exploring one aspect of target countries legal framework (the legality of prostitution), Cho et al. (2013) and Jakobsson and Kotsadam (2013) find that on average, human trafficking is more prevalent in countries where prostitution is legal. Others contest this line of reasoning by arguing that if demand is inelastic, a crackdown in destination countries can increase traffickers profits, leading to higher flows of trafficked individuals when traffickers have access to an internationally diverse range of buyers (Akee et al. 2014). Finally, Tallmadge and Gitter (2018) focus on a more expansive set of possible pull factors, and find higher rates of trafficking in target countries in which immigrants represent a larger share of the population, there is access to the sea, per capita GDP is low, the level of unemployment is high, and prostitution is legal.
