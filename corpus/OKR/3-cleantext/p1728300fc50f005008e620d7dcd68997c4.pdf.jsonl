Between 2017 and 2020, an average of US$634 million annually was allocated to the Rohingya crisis response.5 The humanitarian effort has been largely successful in delivering basic needs and food security to the displaced population. However, local governments have limited funds and capacities to collaborate actively in the response. In general, district and local governments in Bangladesh have a limited role in charting policy and shaping public investments. As a result, there are often few avenues for local communities to influence policy agendas that may affect their welfare. In particular, elected local government representatives rarely participate in the identification, appraisal, approval, implementation, and monitoring of investment projects funded through the Annual Development Plans.
