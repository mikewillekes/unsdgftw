To illustrate, institutional strengthening was valuable for one of Argentinas provinces with the highest share of poor households, and the benefits of the Banks direct engagement was recognized by high-level provincial authorities and public officials. This is usually not the case when the support to SNGs happens through an engagement with the national government, where provinces and municipalities are sometimes pilots and get to interact with Bank staff much less often during the lifetime of the project.  Subnational public management strengthening is a prerequisite for improvements in service delivery in any single sector. In the case of Argentina, reforms in cross-cutting public administration platforms and processes were important foundations for strengthening rural water management. Other sectors also benefited from improvements in cross-cutting public management system.  Political commitment is key in a project that aims at improvements in public resource management systems and practices. However, sustaining support from top management at key ministries is as crucial, particularly for institutional reform projects where the timeframe of implementation is usually very long. Political commitment can in fact vary with changes in government, but support from technical leadership ensures deeper rooting of reforms, and makes policy reversals more difficult. Correspondingly, sustained support of the top management of the bureaucratic apparatus is just as important.  Without local leadership, decentralization projects cannot succeed. The interventions under the State Employment and Expenditure for Results project have the potential to be scaled up across Nigeria, even though their impact was variable within the four SEEFOR states. The main explanation for this variability was the leadership provided by the respective governor of the state as well as heads of department. Strong local leadership was provided in the state of Edo which was the best performer in terms of PFM results.

Large multi-sector results-based operations with disbursement-linked indicators can offer strong incentives for reform, ensuring that a wider array of policy changes can be implemented smoothly and expeditiously. Sector-specific operations cannot sufficiently address issues that require cooperation of different line ministries, some of which may not have any financial stake in the successful implementation of the reforms supported by the project. In the case of SEEFOR, collaboration and joint work across sectors both on the Bank and the clients side had significant pay-off and was more impactful than single sector interventions. This holds particularly true for problems that are multi-pronged and cut across sectors.  The implementation of subnational governance projects is resource intensive. The complexity of the SEEFOR project required significant financial and human resources to provide implementation support. In order to provide a sufficient level of technical assistance for the implementation of subnational projects which cover several subnational governments, we need to think about a new modality, such as shifting more responsibilities to clients in the implementation of projects.

The Banks know-how can be as important as its ability to mobilize significant financial resources. The Government of Minas Gerais made clear that one of the key factors for choosing the Bank as the projects financier was its ability to provide valuable inputs to the design of the program, and to advise during program implementation.  It is important to ensure that risk mitigation measures do not create other risks. In the case of the Public Sector Strengthening Program in Argentina, the risk mitigation measure of bundling technical assistance activities into a single, large contract was appropriate to mitigate the impact of limited implementation capacity.

A more thorough market study during project preparation would have foreseen this development.  Keeping an eye on macroeconomic developments can help anticipate threats to development outcomes and build-in sustainability measures prior to project closing. In the case of Argentina, fiscal tightening threatened budget predictability and the linkage between budgeting and planning. The deterioration in macroeconomic situation reduced the share of primary expenditures in budgets due to cuts in public spending, which ultimately affected budget predictability particularly for the delivery of critical public services. In addition, the provincial governments were slow in articulation of a vision for development and making the connection between planning and budgeting.  Digital technology can be effective for improving M&E. In Nigeria, through the creation of a Geographic Information System-based digital database, the project facilitated third party monitoring of results, and citizens feedback through a call center. All this was complemented through a well-designed communication program that used social media, video, print media and radio to reach out to local communities and beneficiaries. This approach was more suitable in the conflict prone region of the Niger Delta where communities needed to be informed and own the different aspects of the project as beneficiaries.  Complex Integrated Financial Management Information Systems can be effective for improving PFM, however their exact cost can be hard to predict. This was exemplified in the Nigeria project which successfully implemented Oracle and SAP-based IFMIS solutions in four states. However, even though the IFMIS interventions were successful, in the initial stages not all functionalities of the system were being used. For example, the Procure to Pay modules were not operational and much of the workflow processes were outside of the system. Complex IFMIS systems sometimes have a limited shelf life as they get overtaken by upgraded versions. Therefore, if the existing system functionalities are not fully utilized, the investment is also suboptimal or inefficient. There is an added pressure to move to the subsequent version to align and harmonize with other systems at the subnational and national level, thus leading to additional costs. Additionally, global experience has shown that such complex systems need highly competent manpower and good infrastructure.
