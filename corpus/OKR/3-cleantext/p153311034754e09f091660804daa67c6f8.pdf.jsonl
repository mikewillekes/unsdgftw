Between 1961 and 1984 the city of Ouagadougou saw several  fruitless  attempts to create bus companies. In 1961, France's cooperation agency donated three buses to Ouagadougou for public transport; they stopped operating two years later. Later attempts initiated in 1969, 1976 and 1981 proved inconclusive. In 1984, the national public transport company X9 was set up to operate an urban public transport network in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, but also inter-city and international services, so that revenue from the latter two market segments would cover the urban service deficit. X9 ran 30-40 buses for 10 years. Like many public urban transport companies, it was privatized in 1994 as part of the Structural Adjustment Program. The recommendation was to deregulate the market, rather than have a service operated by companies accused of poor management. However, competition from other transport modes, operating conditions made tougher by traffic growth, the fares applied, and weak management by the public authorities caused the private companies to fail.

It began operating with a fleet of 40 buses26 and a single-ticket fare of 200 FCFA. But here too, they suffered from fleet shrinkage due to the very low quality of the buses and to poor maintenance. Following repeated breakdowns, SOTRACO's fleet had decreased to 25 vehicles by 2006, and to 20 vehicles in 2007. Ten years later, only eight vehicles were still operating in Ouagadougou. This level of service, far too inadequate to be attractive, was maintained to stop the company from failing, and the operating deficit was covered by the authorities. Following student demands in 2018, the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Innovation donated 75 buses to SOTRACO to develop services to the university sites. This new fleet enabled the company to bounce back by developing new services in Bobo-Dioulasso and Koudougou.

The program conducted in Dakar in the 2000s is used as a point of reference in the sub-region. Led by the public transport authority  the Executive Council of Urban Transport in Dakar (CETUD)  the program made it possible to renew a fleet of extremely outdated vehicles and better organize the citys informal transport operators. The network was restructured to improve its performance in terms of providing regional services and the frequency of those services without neglecting the issue of ensuring the financial sustainability of the initiative for the operators. Though not yet perfect, the initiative has made it possible to improve service and to protect the health of professionals in the sector, not to mention the programs very satisfactory economic and financial profitability (repayment rate of almost 99%). This type of program has recently been launched in another format in Bamako, targeting the drivers of Sotrama minibuses (see Box 22).
