One strategy often cited is further integrating developing countries into global trade, particularly global value chains (GVCs), to contribute to female labor market outcomes through the expansion of female-intensive industries. As a result, a big question frequently debated, is whether the apparel industry – which is the most female-intensive and globally engaged manufacturing industry – can be a key player in this regard. In recent decades, the apparel industry has shifted its production to low-wage developing countries, increasing the demand for women, closing male-female wage gaps, and bringing women into the formal labor force. Indeed, the benefits of apparel exports have reached the female population, but is an apparel-led export strategy sufficient to induce the transition from jobs to careers? This Report provides an answer by focusing on seven countries wh",2022

The country aims to increase the share of clean energy in its total primary energy supply to at least 20 percent by 2030 and 30 percent by 2045 and has pledged to phase out coal-fueled power generation and made a commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Trade can be a central part of the solution to climate change Vietnam is experiencing and will have to deal with in years to come. Green trade or cleaner trade, trade in environmental or environmentally friendly goods can help Vietnam achieve not only its climate commitments but also its development ambition to become a high-income economy by 2045 as set out in the 2021–2030 Social Economic Development Strategy (SEDS).

WIM organizations generally evolve organically and are structured, managed,and financed in accordance with their membership composition, location, context,and purpose. Most are independent but welcome coordination and joint initiativeswhile others are organized under the umbrella of an industry association or abusiness.

Myriad factors support a successful place, including not only the hard infrastructure such as roads, but also the softer elements such as worker skills, entrepreneurial ability, and well-functioning institutions. History suggests that prosperous places tend to persist, while “left-behind” regions—or those hurt by climatic, technological, or commercial shocks—struggle to catch up. This division gives rise to demands to “do something” about the subsequent spatial inequality. Such pressures often result in costly spatially targeted policies with disappointing outcomes because of a lack of analysis of the underlying barriers to growth and structural transformation and a fair appraisal of the possibility of overcoming them.

The authors use census microdata across 64 countries over the period 1960 to 2012, covering 442 million individual records, combined with geo-referenced temperature and precipitation data summarized for each origin and destination administrative unit. Migration is identified when an individual changed a place of usual residence one, five, or ten years ago to a new major administrative unit in the same country. Given an exceptionally large number of observations, the authors apply a two-step approach to analyze the relationship between exposure to climatic shocks and migration. First, the authors use random forest models to uncover that in many countries climatic shocks are as important as better-known individual-level covariates in determining migration decisions. This observation serves as a yardstick for the second step of the analysis. For a subset of countries, where rainfall shoc",2022

The proposed sovereign climate and nature reporting framework would assist sovereigns looking to attract investment by enabling them to produce comprehensive, regular, standardized, and, eventually, forward-looking disclosures of their climate- and nature related risks and opportunities. Sovereign reporting would help meet the needs of investors who are increasingly requesting such disclosures for all asset classes in their portfolios so that they can measure portfolio alignment with the Paris Agreement.

Despite the importance of action from multiple levels of government, public sector reforms to address climate change and to promote decentralization and or intergovernmental relations tend to be designed and managed separately. Intergovernmental relations have administrative, fiscal, and political dimensions. This paper focuses on climate action at the subnational government level through administrative decentralization and intergovernmental collaboration. The Paris Agreement acknowledges the climate change-decentralization connection, noting a need for the engagement of all levels of government and various actors. The bottom line is that the appropriate mix of subnational climate actions will vary because climate change needs and feasible responses, as well as intergovernmental structures and the nature and degree of decentralization, differ across coun",2022

Given smaller sectoral productivity gaps than commonly assumed, greater size effects and larger spillovers, investment in agriculture and the rural off-farm economy remains warranted to broker the transition to more and more productive rural employment. The key policy questions thus become how best to invest in the agri-food system (on and increasingly also off the farm) and how best to generate demand for nonagricultural goods and services which rural households can competitively produce.

This paper uses original household data from five waves of a phone survey conducted between May 2020 and June 2021 in Kenya (sample size 31,715) and investigates the gender differences in household coping strategies during the COVID-19 shock. It finds that female-headed households are less likely to cope by selling assets or taking loans, compared with male-headed households. Instead, femaleheaded households rely more on social networks to cope. No difference in coping by reducing meals is observed across these two types of households. This paper documents that the reasons behind the gender difference include that female-headed households are poorer, and they are more likely to rely on friends and family to cope with shocks even prior to the COVID-19 shock. The findings suggest that widowed an",2022

In the LTGM-Natural Resource Extension (LTGM-NR), commodity price shocks affect long-term economic growth through physical investment rates. As a large share of resource income typically accrues to the government, the size of the boost to investment in a price boom depends on the government’s fiscal rule. Fiscal rules that prioritize public investment, like a Hartwick Rule, generally lead to the largest increases in long-term growth. However, structural surplus rules, which save commodity revenues, can also boost growth if they free up savings for private investment. The response of growth to discoveries of natural resources is similar to the response to price shocks, although discoveries also produce a direct effect on real GDP, in addi",2022

Firstly, the authors analyze the geographical dimension of refugee camps in Africa by shedding light on the heterogeneous location patterns of hosting camps across countries as well as the economic settings in which refugee camps are situated, which allows us to identify the main determinants of such patterns. Second, the authors investigate the effects of hosting refugees in camps on the occurrence of protests and social conflicts, by using geo-referenced panel data from a large sample of African countries between 2000 and 2014. The main analysis is performed by using 50x50 km cells as units of analysis, GDELT and GED data on the frequency of protests, armed conflicts and other organized violence events and data from UNHCR Camp Mapping Database. By using a counterfactual empirical strategy, the authors find that refugee camps significantly increase the occurrence of protests only in the first two years while no significant effect is detected ",2022

This paper reports the effects on diarrhea prevention, curative care, and incidence as well as anthropometrics for 1649 children from a randomized control trial in Bamako that cross-randomized CHW visits and access to free health care. CHW visits improve prevention and subsidies increase the use of curative care for acute illness, with some indication of positive interaction effects.

It also explores the role that institutions play through enforcing the rule of law, providing access to justice, and implementing anti-trafficking policies, as protective factors that could weaken the link between economic shocks and an increase in human trafficking. The analysis verifies that economic shocks are significant risk factors that increase vulnerability to human trafficking. In origin countries, economic vulnerabilities, especially those caused by global commodity price shocks, are strongly positively correlated with observed cases of trafficking. For instance, the economic shock produced by a typical decrease in export commodity prices is associated with an increase in the number of detected victims of trafficking of around 12 perc",2022

While there has been some progress in recent years, inequality has remained almost stagnant in the most unequal countries. Using an innovative framework, this report provides a systematic and comprehensive analysis of inequality in the region. The main conclusions are as follows: first, inherited circumstances over which an individual has little or no control (i.e., inequality of opportunity) drive overall inequality, and their contribution has increased in recent years. This is an important concern particularly because this type of inequality is not the result of people’s efforts. Second, lack of access to jobs and means of production (education, skills, land, among others) by disadvantaged populations slows progress towards a more equitable income distribution. In a context where jobs are scarce, having post-secondary or tertiary education is key to both accessing jobs, and obtaining better wa",2022
