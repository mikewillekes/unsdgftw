Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning services such as food, water, timber, and fiber; regulating services that affect climate, floods, disease, wastes, and water quality; cultural services that provide recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits; and supporting services such as soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of response options that can be considered to realize or avoid specific futures?  What are the key uncertainties that hinder effective decision-making concerning ecosystems?  What tools and methodologies developed and used in the MA can strengthen capacity to assess ecosystems, the services they provide, their impacts on human well-being, and the strengths and weaknesses of response options? The MA was conducted as a multiscale assessment, with interlinked assessments undertaken at local, watershed, national, regional, and global scales. A global ecosystem assessment cannot easily meet all the needs of decision-makers at national and sub-national scales because the management of any particular ecosystem must be tailored to the particular characteristics of that ecosystem and to the demands placed on it. However, an assessment focused only on a particular ecosystem or particular nation is insufficient because some processes are global and because local goods, services, matter, and energy are often transferred across regions. Each of the component assessments was guided by the MA conceptual framework and benefited from the presence of assessments undertaken at larger and smaller scales. The sub-global assessments were not intended to serve as representative samples of all ecosystems; rather, they were to meet the needs of decision-makers at the scales at which they were undertaken."}

Because of the broad scope of the MA and the complexity of the interactions between social and natural systems, it proved to be difficult to provide definitive information for some of the issues addressed in the MA. Relatively few ecosystem services have been the focus of research and monitoring and, as a consequence, research findings and data are often inadequate for a detailed global assessment. Moreover, the data and information that are available are generally related to either the characteristics of the ecological system or the characteristics of the social system, not to the all-important interactions between these systems. Finally, the scientific and assessment tools and models available to undertake a cross-scale integrated assessment and to project future changes in ecosystem services are only now being developed. Despite these challenges, the MA was able to provide considerable information relevant to most of the focal questions. And by identifying gaps in data and information that prevent policy-relevant questions from being answered, the assessment can help to guide research and monitoring that may allow those questions to be answered in future assessments."}

The creation of a market in the form of a nutrient trading system may also be a low-cost way to reduce excessive nutrient loading in the United States.  Payment for ecosystem services. For example, in 1996 Costa Rica established a nationwide system of conservation payments to induce landowners to provide ecosystem services.

Changes to ecosystems have contributed to a significant rise in the number of floods and major wildfires on all continents since the 1940s. Ecosystems serve an important role in detoxifying wastes introduced into the environment, but there are intrinsic limits to that waste processing capability. For example, aquatic ecosystems cleanse on average 80% of their global incident nitrogen loading, but this intrinsic selfpurification capacity varies widely and is being reduced by the loss of wetlands.  Cultural Services: Although the use of cultural services has continued to grow, the capability of ecosystems to provide cultural benefits has been significantly diminished in the past century. Human cultures are strongly influenced by ecosystems, and ecosystem change can have a significant impact on cultural identity and social stability. Human cultures, knowledge systems, religions, heritage values, social interactions, and the linked amenity services have always been influenced and shaped by the nature of the ecosystem and ecosystem conditions. Many of these benefits are being degraded, either through changes to ecosystems or through societal changes that reduce peoples recognition or appreciation of those cultural benefits.

Vector-borne diseases cause approximately 1.4 million deaths a year, mainly due to malaria in Africa. These infections are both an effect and a cause of poverty. Prevalence of a number of infectious diseases appears to be growing, and environmental changes such as deforestation, dam construction, road building, agricultural conversion, and urbanization are contributing factors in many cases.  Medicines: The use of natural products in the pharmaceutical industry has tended to fluctuate widely, with a general decline in pharmaceutical bioprospecting by major companies. Historically, most drugs were obtained from natural products. Even near the end of the twentieth century, approximately 50% of prescription medicines were originally discovered in plants. Natural products still are actively used in drug exploration. Medicinal plants continue to play an important role in health care systems in many parts of the world. One MA subglobal assessment in the Mekong wetlands identified more than 280 medically important plant species, of which 150 are still in regular use.

Three of the MA scenarios project reductions in child undernourishment by 2050 of between 10% and 60%, but undernourishment increases by 10% in Order from Strength. This is due to a combination of factors related to food supply systems and food demand and accessibility.  Vast, complex changes with great geographic variability are projected to occur in world freshwater resources and hence in their provisioning of ecosystem services in all scenarios. Climate change will lead to increased precipitation over more than half of Earths surface, and this will make more water available to society and ecosystems. However, increased precipitation is also likely to increase the frequency of flooding in many areas. Increases in precipitation will not be universal, and climate change will also cause a substantial decrease in precipitation in some areas, with an accompanying decrease in water availability. These areas could include highly populated arid regions such as the Middle East and Southern Europe. While water withdrawals decrease in most industrial countries, they are expected to increase substantially in Africa and some other developing regions, along with wastewater discharges, overshadowing the possible benefits of increased water availability.  A deterioration of the services provided by freshwater resources is expected in developing countries under the scenarios that are reactive to environmental problems. Less severe but still important declines are expected in the scenarios that are more proactive about environmental problems.  Growing demand for fish and fish products leads to an increasing risk of a major and long-lasting collapse of regional marine fisheries.

Fish populations are generally able to withstand some level of catch with a relatively small impact on their overall population size. As the catch increases, however, a threshold is reached after which too few adults remain to produce enough offspring to support that level of harvest, and the population may drop abruptly to a much smaller size. For example, the Atlantic cod stocks of the east coast of Newfoundland collapsed in 1992, forcing the closure of the fishery after hundreds of years of exploitation, as shown in Figure 3.4. Most important, the stocks may take years to recover or not recover at all, even if harvesting is significantly reduced or eliminated entirely.  Species introductions and losses: Introductions of species can cause nonlinear changes in ecosystems and their services. For example, the introduction of the zebra mussel into U.S. aquatic systems resulted in the extirpation of native clams in Lake St. Clair, large changes in energy flow and ecosystem function, and annual costs of $100 million to the power industry and other users. The introduction of the comb jelly fish in the Black Sea caused the loss of 26 major fisheries species and has been implicated in subsequent growth of the anoxic dead zone. The loss of the sea otters from many coastal ecosystems on the Pacific Coast of North America due to hunting led to the booming populations of sea urchins which in turn led to the loss of kelp forests.  Changes in dominant species in coral ecosystems: Some coral reef ecosystems have undergone sudden shifts from coral-dominated to algae-dominated reefs. The trigger for such phase shifts, which are essentially irreversible, is usually multifaceted and includes increased nutrient input leading to eutrophic conditions, and removal of herbivorous fishes that maintain the balance between corals and algae. Once a threshold is reached, the change in the ecosystem takes place within months and the resulting ecosystem, although stable, is less productive and less diverse. One well-studied example is the sudden switch in 1983 from coral to algal domination of Jamaican reef systems. This followed several centuries of overfishing of herbivores, which left the control of algal cover almost entirely dependent on a single species of sea urchin, whose populations collapsed when exposed to a species-specific pathogen. As a result, Jamaicas reefs shifted to a new low-diversity, algae-dominated state with very limited capacity to support fisheries.

The increased likelihood of these events stems from the following factors:  On balance, changes humans are making to ecosystems are reducing the resilience of the ecological components of the systems. Genetic and species diversity, as well as spatial patterns of landscapes, environmental fluctuations, and temporal cycles with which species evolved, generate the resilience of ecosystems. Functional groups of species contribute to ecosystem processes and services in similar ways. Diversity among functional groups increases the flux of ecosystem processes and services. Within functional groups, species respond differently to environmental fluctuations. This response diversity derives from variation in the response of species to environmental drivers, heterogeneity in species distributions, differences in ways that species use seasonal cycles or disturbance patterns, or other mechanisms. Response diversity enables ecosystems to adjust in changing environments, altering biotic structure in ways that maintain processes and services. The loss of biodiversity that is now taking place thus tends to reduce the resilience of ecosystems.  There are growing pressures from various drivers. Threshold changes in ecosystems are not uncommon, but they are infrequently encountered in the absence of human-caused pressures on ecosystems. Many of these pressures are now growing. Increased fish harvests raise the likelihood of fisheries collapses; higher rates of climate change boost the potential for species extinctions; increased introductions of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment make the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems more likely; as human populations become more mobile, more and more species are being introduced into new habitats, and this increases the chance of harmful pests emerging in those regions."}

This could place them at risk of extinction and also reduce the food supply of the people dependent on these resources.

Compensatory mechanisms may be needed for the poor who are adversely affected by the immediate removal of subsidies. Reduced subsidies within the OECD may lessen pressures on some ecosystems in those countries, but they could lead to more rapid conversion and intensification of land for agriculture in developing countries and would thus need to be accompanied by policies to minimize the adverse impacts on ecosystems there.  Greater use of economic instruments and market-based approaches in the management of ecosystem services. Economic instruments and market mechanisms with the potential to enhance the management of ecosystem services include:  Taxes or user fees for activities with external costs. These instruments create an incentive that lessens the external costs and provides revenues that can help protect the damaged ecosystem services. Examples include taxes on excessive application of nutrients or ecotourism user fees.  Creation of markets, including through cap-and-trade systems. Ecosystem services that have been treated as free resources, as is often the case for water, tend to be used wastefully. The establishment of markets for the services can both increase the incentives for their conservation and increase the economic efficiency of their allocation if supporting legal and economic institutions are in place. However, as noted earlier, while markets will increase the efficiency of the use of the resource, they can have harmful effects on particular groups of users who may inequitably affected by the change. The combination of regulated emission caps, coupled with market mechanisms for trading pollution rights, often provides an efficient means of reducing emissions harmful to ecosystems. For example, nutrient trading systems may be a low-cost way to reduce water pollution in the United States."}

The World Bank has established a fund with a capital of $33.3 million to invest in afforestation and reforestation projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forest and agroecosystems while promoting biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. It is speculated that the value of the global carbon emissions trading markets may reach $10 billion to $44 billion in 2010.  Payment for ecosystem services. Mechanisms can be established to enable individuals, firms, or the public sector to pay resource owners to provide particular services. For example, in New South Wales, Australia, associations of farmers purchase salinity credits from the State Forests Agency, which in turn contracts with upstream landholders to plant trees, which reduce water tables and store carbon. Similarly, in 1996 Costa Rica established a nationwide system of conservation payments to induce landowners to provide ecosystem services. Under this program, the government brokers contracts between international and domestic buyers and local sellers of sequestered carbon, biodiversity, watershed services, and scenic beauty.

Aquaculture systems now account for roughly 27% of total fish production.  The level of global output of cereals has stagnated since 1996, so grain stocks have been in decline. Although there is concern about these trends, they may reflect only a normal cycle of market adjustment.  Although there has been some cereal price increase since 2001, prices are still some 3040% lower than their peak in the mid-1990s.  Current patterns of use of capture fisheries are unsustainable. Humans increased the capture of marine fish up until the 1980s by harvesting an ever-growing fraction of the available resource. Marine fish landings are now declining as a result of the overexploitation of this resource. Inland water fisheries, which are particularly important in providing high-quality diets for poor people, have also declined due to habitat modification, overfishing, and water withdrawals.  While traditional aquaculture is generally sustainable, an increasing share of aquaculture uses carnivorous species, and this puts increased pressure on other fisheries to provide fishmeal as feed and also exacerbates waste problems.

Ecosystem changes account for about 1030% of the radiative forcing of CO2 since 1750 and a large proportion of the radiative forcing due to CH4 and N2O. Ecosystems are currently a net sink for CO2 and tropospheric ozone, while they remain a net source of CH4 and N2O. Future management of ecosystems has the potential to modify concentrations of a number of greenhouse gases, although this potential is likely to be small in comparison to IPCC scenarios of fossil fuel emissions over the next century. Ecosystems influence the main anthropogenic greenhouse gases as follows:  Carbon dioxide: About 40% of the historical emissions, and about 20% of current CO2 emissions, originated from changes in land use and land management, primarily deforestation. Terrestrial ecosystems were a sink for about a third of cumulative historical emissions and a third of total emissions in the 1990s. The sink may be explained partially by afforestation, reforestation, and forest management in North America, Europe, China, and other regions and partially by the fertilizing effects of N deposition and increasing atmospheric CO2. Terrestrial ecosystems were on average a net source of CO2 during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and became a net sink sometime around the middle of the last century. The net impact of ocean biology changes on global CO2 fluxes is unknown.  Methane: Natural processes in wetland ecosystems account for about 2530% of current methane emissions, and about 30% of emissions are due to agriculture.  Nitrous oxide: Ecosystem sources account for about 90% of current N2O emissions, with 35% of emissions from agricultural systems, primarily driven by fertilizer use.  Tropospheric ozone: Dry deposition in ecosystems accounts for about half the tropospheric ozone sink. Several gases emitted by ecosystems, primarily due to biomass burning, act as precursors for tropospheric ozone formation. The net global effect of ecosystems is as a sink for tropospheric O3."}

Here, we consider a much narrower service provided by ecosystems related to human health: the role of ecosystems in regulating infectious disease.

Ecosystem modifications associated with developments such as dam building and the expansion of agricultural irrigation, for example, have sometimes increased the local incidence of infectious diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, and arbovirus infections, especially in the tropics.

Major tropical diseases, particularly malaria, meningitis, leishmaniasis, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, African trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, filariasis, and diarrheal diseases still infect millions of people throughout the world.  The prevalence of the following infectious diseases is particularly strongly influenced by ecological change: malaria across most ecological systems; schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and Japanese encephalitis in cultivated and inland water systems in the tropics; dengue fever in tropical urban centers; leishmaniasis and Chagas disease in forest and dryland systems; meningitis in the Sahel; cholera in coastal, freshwater, and urban systems; and West Nile virus and Lyme disease in urban and suburban systems of Europe and North America.  Various changes to ecosystems can affect disease incidence through a variety of mechanisms. Disease/ecosystem relationships that best exemplify these biological mechanisms include the following examples:  Dams and irrigation canals provide ideal habitat for snails that serve as the intermediate reservoir host species for schistosomiasis; irrigated rice fields increase in the extent of mosquito-breeding surface, increasing the chance of transmission of mosquito-borne malaria, lymphatic filariasis, Japanese encephalitis, and Rift Valley fever.  Deforestation has increased the risk of malaria in Africa and South America by increasing habitat suitable for malariatransmitting mosquitoes.  Natural systems with preserved structure and characteristics generally resist the introduction of invasive human and animal pathogens brought by human migration and settlement. This seems to be the case for cholera, kala-azar, and schistosomiasis, which did not become established in the Amazonian forest ecosystem.  Uncontrolled urbanization in the forest ecosystem has been associated with mosquito-borne viruses in the Amazon and with lymphatic filariasis in Africa. Tropical urban areas with poor water supply systems and lack of shelter promote transmission of dengue fever.  There is evidence that habitat fragmentation, with subsequent biodiversity loss, increases the prevalence in ticks of the bacteria that causes Lyme disease in North America.  Zoonotic pathogens are a significant cause of both historical and newly emerging infectious diseases affecting humans. In addition, zoonotic pathogens can cause high case-fatality rates and are difficult to vaccinate against, since the primary reservoir hosts are nonhumans.  Intensive livestock agriculture that uses subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli bacteria. Overcrowded and mixed livestock practices, as well as the trade in bushmeat, can facilitate interspecies host transfer of disease agents, leading to dangerous novel pathogens such as SARS and new strains of influenza."}

These actions are exacerbating human vulnerability to extreme events, such as the December 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Many measures of human vulnerability show a general increase due to growing poverty, mainly in developing countries.  Roughly 17% of all the urban land in the United States is located in the 100-year flood zone. Likewise, in Japan about 50% of the population lives on floodplains, which cover only 10% of the land area. In Bangladesh, the percentage of floodprone areas is much higher and inundation of more than half of the country is not uncommon. For example, about two thirds of the country was inundated in the 1998 flood.  Many of the available datasets on extreme events show that impacts are increasing in many regions around the world. From 1992 to 2001, floods were the most frequent natural disaster, and they killed 96,507 people and affected more than 1.2 billion people over the decade. Annual economic losses from extreme events increased tenfold from the 1950s to the 1990s.  The loss of ecosystems such as wetlands and mangroves has significantly reduced natural mechanisms of protection from natural hazards. For example, forested riparian wetlands adjacent to the Mississippi River in the United States during presettlement times had the capacity to store about 60 days of river discharge. With the removal of wetlands through canalization, leveeing, and draining, the remaining wetlands have a storage capacity of less than 12 days dischargean 80% reduction of flood storage capacity.  The number of floods and fires increased significantly on all continents over the past 60 years.  Within industrial countries, the area burned by fires is declining but the number of major fires is increasing. In the United States, for example, the area burned has declined by more than 90% since 1930, while in Sweden the area burned annually fell from about 12,000 hectares in 1876 to about 400 hectares in 1989. In North America, however, the number of fire disasters10 or more people reportedly killed, 100 people reportedly affected, a declared state of emergency, and a call for international assistanceincreased from about 10 in the 1980s to about 45 during the 1990s."}

Under this definition, biodiversity can be lost either if the diversity per se is reduced or if the potential of the components of diversity to provide a particular service is diminished. The homogenization of biodiversitythat is, the spread of invasive alien species around the worldthus also represents a loss of biodiversity at a global scale even though the diversity of species in particular regions may actually increase because of the arrival of new species. and water quality; cultural services such as recreation, aesthetic enjoyment, and spiritual fulfillment; and supporting services such as soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling. The MA assesses the indirect and direct drivers of change in ecosystems and their services, the current condition of those services, and how changes in ecosystem services have affected human wellbeing. It uses a broad definition of human well-being, examining how ecosystem changes influence income and material needs, health, good social relations, security, and freedom of choice and action. The MA developed four global scenarios exploring plausible future changes in drivers, ecosystems, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Finally, the assessment examined the strengths and weaknesses of various response options that have been used to manage ecosystem services and identified promising opportunities for enhancing human well-being while conserving ecosystems."}

Market mechanisms have helped to conserve some aspects of biodiversity and to support its sustainable usefor example, in the context of ecotourism. In many countries, tax incentives, easements, tradable development permit programs, and contractual arrangements are becoming more common and have often been shown to be useful for conserving land and ecosystem services. Between 1996 and 2001, for example, Costa Rica provided $30 million to landowners to establish or protect over 280,000 hectares of forests and their environmental services. Similarly, carbon markets, which offer long-term gains in carbon sequestration, can provide incentives for conservation, especially if designed well such that they do not harm biodiversity conservation efforts. While more market-oriented approaches such as these show considerable promise, many challenges remain, such as the difficulty of obtaining the information needed to ensure that the buyers are indeed obtaining the services that they are paying for and the need to establish underlying institutional frameworks required for markets to work and ensure benefits are distributed in an equitable manner. Market reforms can be made to work better, and in a world of decentralized decision-making, improving market mechanisms may be essential to both sustainable use and conservation.  Incorporating considerations of biodiversity conservation into management practices in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Two types of opportunities exist. First, more diverse sys- tems of production can often be as effective as alternative low-diversity systems, or sometimes even more effective. For example, integrated pest management can increase biodiversity on farms, lower costs by reducing the need for pesticides, and meet the growing demand for organic food products. Second, strategies that promote the intensification of production rather than the expansion of the total area of production allow more area for conservation, as described later. Agricultural policy reforms in a number of countries are now beginning to take biodiversity into account, but much more can be done to reduce harmful impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services."}

Some of the people benefiting from production subsidies are poor and would be harmed by their removal. Compensatory mechanisms may be needed for these groups. Moreover, removal of agricultural subsidies within the OECD would need to be accompanied by actions designed to minimize adverse impacts on ecosystem services in developing countries. But the basic challenge remains that the current economic system relies fundamentally on economic growth that disregards its impact on natural resources.  Sustainable intensification of agriculture. The expansion of agriculture will continue to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss well into the twenty-first century. In regions where agricultural expansion continues to be a large threat to biodiversity, the development, assessment, and diffusion of technologies that could increase the production of food per unit area sustainably, without harmful trade-offs related to excessive consumption of water or use of nutrients or pesticides, would significantly lessen pressure on biodiversity. In many cases, appropriate technologies already exist that could be applied more widely, but countries lack the financial resources and institutional capabilities to gain and use these technologies. Where agriculture already dominates landscapes, the maintenance of biodiversity within these areas is an important component of total biodiversity conservation efforts, and, if managed appropriately, can also contribute to agricultural productivity and sustainability through the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides.  Slowing and adapting to climate change. Significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are technically feasible due to an extensive array of technologies in the energy supply, energy demand, and waste management sectors. Reducing projected emissions will require the development and implementation of supporting institutions and policies to overcome barriers to the diffusion of these technologies into the marketplace, increased public and private-sector funding for research and development, and effective technology transfer. Given the inertia in the climate system, actions to facilitate the adaptation of biodiversity and ecosystems to climate change will also be necessary to mitigate negative impacts. These may include the development of ecological corridors or networks.  Addressing unsustainable consumption patterns. Consumption of ecosystem services and nonrenewable resources affects biodiversity and ecosystems directly and indirectly. Total consumption is a factor of per capita consumption, population, and efficiency of resource use. Slowing biodiversity loss requires that the combined effect of these factors be reduced.  Slowing the global growth in nutrient loading. Technologies already exist for reduction of nutrient pollution at reasonable costs, but new policies are needed for these tools to be applied on a sufficient scale to slow and ultimately reverse the increase in nutrient loading.  Correction of market failures and internalization of environmental externalities that lead to the degradation of ecosystem services. Because many ecosystem services are not formally traded, markets fail to provide appropriate signals that might otherwise contribute to the efficient allocation and sustainable use. In addition, many of the harmful trade-offs and costs associated with the management of one ecosystem service are borne by others and so are not weighed in sectoral decisions regarding the management of that service. In countries with supportive institutions in place, market-based tools could be more effectively applied to correct some market failures and internalize externalities, particularly with respect to provisioning ecosystem services. Various economic instruments or market-based approaches that show promise, in addition to the creation of new markets for ecosystem services and payments for ecosystem services noted earlier, include taxes or user fees for activities with external costs, capand-trade systems for reduction of pollutants, and mechanisms to allow consumer preferences to be expressed through markets."}

Protected areas, restoration ecology, and markets for ecosystem services will have higher chances of success if these responses are reflected in the national development strategies or in poverty reduction strategies, in the case of many developing countries. At the same time, development plans can be more effective if they take into account existing plans and priorities for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.  Increased transparency and accountability of government and private-sector performance in decisions that affect ecosystems, including through greater involvement of concerned stakeholders in decision-making. Laws, policies, institutions, and markets that have been shaped through public participation in decision-making are more likely to be effective and perceived as just. Stakeholder participation also contributes to the decision-making process because it allows for a better understanding of impacts and vulnerability, the distribution of costs and benefits associated with trade-offs, and the identification of a broader range of response options that are available in a specific context. And stakeholder involvement and transparency of decision-making can increase accountability and reduce corruption.  Scientific findings and data need to be made available to all of society. A major obstacle for knowing, preserving, sustainably using, and sharing benefits equitably from the biodiversity of a region is the human and institutional capacity to research a countrys biota. The CONABIO initiative in Mexico and INBio in Costa Rica offer examples of successful national models for converting basic taxonomic information into knowledge for biodiversity conservation policies, as well as for other policies relating to ecosystems and biodiversity and for use in education and economic development."}

Except for the last 1,000 years, global biodiversity has been relatively constant over most of human history, but the history of life is characterized by considerable change. The estimated magnitude of background rates of extinction is roughly 0.11.0 extinctions per million species per year. Most measurements of this rate have come from assessing the length of species lifetimes through the fossil record: these range over 0.513 million years, and possibly 0.216 million years. These data probably underestimate background extinction rates because they are necessarily largely derived from taxa that are abundant and widespread in the fossil record. Current rates of extinction are discussed in Key Question 3."}

Substantial ecosystem services are provided by coral reefssuch as habitat construction, nurseries, and spawning grounds for fish; nutrient cycling and carbon and nitrogen fixing in nutrient-poor environments; and wave buffering and sediment stabilization.

Biodiversity affects carbon sequestration primarily through its effects on species characteristics, which determine how much carbon is taken up from the atmosphere and how much is released into it. Particularly important are how fast plants can grow, which governs carbon inputs, and woodiness, which enhances carbon sequestration because woody plants tend to contain more carbon, live longer, and decompose more slowly than smaller herbaceous plants. Plant species also strongly influence carbon loss via decomposition and their effects on disturbance. Plant traits also influence the probability of disturbances such as fire, windthrow, and human harvest, which temporarily change forests from accumulating carbon to releasing it."}

Those with high rankings on the index accounted for over 50% of the total economic losses and less than 2% of the deaths.

Recent studies have demonstrated that global fisheries landings peaked in the late 1980s and are now declining despite increasing effort and fishing power, with little evidence of this trend reversing under current practices. In addition to the landings, the average trophic level of global landings is declining, which implies that we are increasingly relying on fish that originate from the lower part of marine food webs.

In Asia, 78% of the total reservoir volume was constructed in the last decade, and in South America almost 60% of all reservoirs were built since the 1980s. Water withdrawals from rivers and lakes for irrigation or urban or industrial use increased sixfold since 1900. Globally, humans now use roughly 10% of the available renewable freshwater supply, although in some regions, such as the Middle East and North Africa, humans use 120% of renewable suppliesthe excess is obtained through mining groundwater. The introduction of non-native invasive species is now a major cause of species extinction in freshwater systems. It is well established that the increased discharge of nutrients causes intensive eutrophication and potentially high levels of nitrate in drinking water and that pollution from point sources such as mining has had devastating impacts on the biota of inland waters."}

At the national level, integrating biodiversity issues into agriculture, fishery, and forestry management encourages sustainable harvesting and minimizes negative impacts on biodiversity. Biodiversity will only be conserved and sustainably used when it becomes a mainstream concern of production sectors. Agriculture is directly dependent on biodiversity, but agricultural practices in recent decades have focused on maximizing yields. Research and development have focused on few relatively productive species, thus ignoring the potential importance of biodiversity. Effective response strategies include sustainable intensification, which minimizes the need for expanding total area for production, so allowing more area for biodiversity"}

The proliferation of certification programs to meet the needs of different stakeholders has meant that no single program has emerged as the only credible or dominant approach internationally. Forest management policies should center on existing land and water ownership at the community level. Relevant legal tools include redesigning ownership to small-scale private control of forests, public-private partnerships, direct management of forests by indigenous people, and company-community partnerships.

Ecosystems are currently a net sink for carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone, while they remain a net source of methane and nitrous oxide. Management of ecosystems has the potential to significantly modify concentrations of a number of greenhouse gases, although this potential is small in comparison to IPCC scenarios of fossil fuel emissions over the next century. Ecosystems influence the main anthropogenic greenhouse gases in several ways:  Carbon dioxidePreindustrial concentration, 280 parts per million; concentration in 2000, 370 ppm. About 40% of the emissions over the last two centuries and about 20% of the CO2 emissions during the 1990s originated from changes in land use and land management, primarily deforestation. Terrestrial ecosystems have been a sink for about a third of cumulative historical emissions and a third of the 1990s total emissions. The sink may be explained partially by afforestation/ reforestation/forest management in North America, Europe, China, and other regions, and partially by the fertilizing effects of nitrogen deposition and increasing atmospheric CO2. Ecosystems were on average a net source of CO2 during the nineteenth and early twentieth century and became a net sink sometime around the middle of the last century.  MethanePreindustrial concentration, 700 parts per billion; concentration in late 1990s, 1750 ppb.

Within this layer, vertical profiles of temperature and humidity depend strongly on the partitioning of energy between sensible heat and latent heat. Over land, this partitioning is largely controlled by ecosystems. Over bare, dry land, the energy is transported via sensible heat, resulting in relatively high surface air temperatures. Vegetation canopies transpire water extracted from the root zone, increase the upward latent heat flux, and cool the surface air. Modification of the fluxes of water and energy by ecosystems has significant regional effects on precipitation, temperature, and wind. Globally averaged impacts are small, complex, and hard to detect against the background of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change. Key physical properties and processes affected by ecosystems are summarized here:  Surface albedo is the fraction of solar radiation reflected back into the atmosphere from Earths surface. Higher albedo means that more energy leaves the planetary boundary layer. Vegetation traps radiation, generally reducing albedo compared with, for instance, snow cover or bare ground in dry lands. In agricultural regions, tillage usually decreases albedo since bare soil in moist climates is generally darker than plant canopies.

On the Indonesian islands of Kalimantan and Sumatra during 1997 98, an estimated 9 million hectares of vegetation burned. Some 20 million people in Indonesia alone suffered from respiratory problems, mainly asthma, upper respiratory tract illness, and skin and eye irritation during the episode, with nearly four times as many acute respiratory illnesses as normal reported in South Sumatra. A first assessment of costs of damages caused by the fire episode on 45 million hectares was $4.5 billion.  The fires burning in Mexico during the 1998 episode forced the local government to shut down industrial production in order to decrease additional industrial pollution during the fire-generated smog. Daily production losses were about $8 million.  In 2002, forest and peat fires in the Moscow region resulted in the worst haze seen in Moscow in 30 years.

For example, Smith et al. showed that elevated CO2 increased the success of an invasive C4 grass species in the Mojave Desert, potentially reducing biodiversity and altering ecosystem function. As with invasive tree species, this functional shift from grass to trees will also affect biophysical properties, biodiversity, and sources/sinks of various trace gases. Trees are not always the winners; for example, lianas respond more strongly than trees to the fertilizing effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration. Lianas enhance tree mortality and suppress tree growth, which could ultimately reduce carbon storage in forests."}
