For example, in some locations land use change can result in greater nutrient loading (if the land is converted to high-intensity agriculture), increased emissions of greenhouse gases (if forest is cleared), and increased numbers of invasive species (due to the disturbed habitat).  Habitat transformation, particularly from conversion to agriculture: Under the MA scenarios, a further 1020% of grassland and forestland is projected to be converted between 2000 and 2050 (primarily to agriculture), as Figure 2 illustrated.

Changes in supporting services have a strong influence by virtue of their influence on provisioning and regulating services. The following are some examples of material components of well-being affected by ecosystem change.  Income and Employment: Increased production of crops, fisheries, and forest products has been associated with significant growth in local and national economies. Changes in the use and management of these services can either increase employment or decrease it through gains in productivity of labor. In regions where productivity has declined due to land degradation or overharvesting of fisheries, the impacts on local economies and employment can be devastating to the poor or to those who rely on these services for income.  Food: The growth in food production and farm productivity has more than kept pace with global population growth, resulting in significant downward pressure on the price of foodstuffs. Following significant spikes in the 1970s caused primarily by oil crises, there have been persistent and profound reductions in the price of foodstuffs globally. Over the last 40 years, food prices have dropped by around 40% in real terms due to increases in productivity.

The benefits they provide to society, therefore, are largely unrecorded: only a portion of the total benefits provided by an ecosystem make their way into statistics, and many of these are misattributed. Moreover, for ecosystem services that do not pass through markets there is often insufficient incentive for individuals to invest in maintenance. Typically, even if individuals are aware of the services provided by an ecosystem, they are neither compensated for providing these services nor penalized for reducing them. These nonmarketed benefits are often high and sometimes more valuable than the marketed benefits. For example:  Total economic value of forests. One of the most comprehen- sive studies to date, which examined the marketed and nonmarketed economic values associated with forests in eight Mediterranean countries, found that timber and fuelwood generally accounted for less than a third of total economic value in each country.  Recreational benefits of protected areas: The annual recreational value of the coral reefs of each of six Marine Management Areas in the Hawaiian Islands in 2003 ranged from $300,000 to $35 million.  Water quality: The net present value in 1998 of protecting water quality in the 360-kilometer Catawba River in the United States for five years was estimated to be $346 million.  Water purification service of wetlands: About half of the total economic value of the Danube River Floodplain in 1992 could be accounted for in its role as a nutrient sink.  Native pollinators: A study in Costa Rica found that forestbased pollinators increased coffee yields by 20% within 1 kilometer of the forest. During 200003, pollination services from two forest fragments thus increased the income of a 1,100-hectare farm by $60,000 a year, a value commensurate with expected revenues from competing land uses.  Flood control: Muthurajawela Marsh, a 3,100-hectare coastal peat bog in Sri Lanka, provides an estimated $5 million in annual benefits through its role in local flood control.  The total economic value associated with managing ecosystems more sustainably is often higher than the value associated with the conversion of the ecosystem through farming, clear-cut logging, or other intensive uses. Relatively few studies have compared the total economic value of ecosystems under alternate management regimes, but a number of studies that do exist have found that the benefit of managing the ecosystem more sustainably exceeded that of converting the ecosystem, although the private benefitsthat is, the actual monetary benefits captured from the services entering the marketwould favor conversion or unsustainable management. These studies are consistent with the understanding that market failures associated with ecosystem services lead to greater conversion of ecosystems than is economically justified. However, this finding would not hold at all locations.

Moreover, for ecosystem services that do not pass through markets there is often insufficient incentive for individuals to invest in maintenance (although in some cases common property management systems provide such incentives). Typically, even if individuals are aware of the services provided by an ecosystem, they are neither compensated for providing these services nor penalized for reducing them. These nonmarketed benefits are often high and sometimes more valuable than the marketed benefits. For example:  Total economic value of forests. One of the most comprehen- sive studies to date, which examined the marketed and nonmarketed economic values associated with forests in eight Mediterranean countries, found that timber and fuelwood generally accounted for less than a third of total economic value in each country. (See Figure 3.2.)  Recreational benefits of protected areas: The annual recreational value of the coral reefs of each of six Marine Management Areas in the Hawaiian Islands in 2003 ranged from $300,000 to $35 million.  Water quality: The net present value in 1998 of protecting water quality in the 360-kilometer Catawba River in the United States for five years was estimated to be $346 million.  Water purification service of wetlands: About half of the total economic value of the Danube River Floodplain in 1992 could be accounted for in its role as a nutrient sink.  Native pollinators: A study in Costa Rica found that forestbased pollinators increased coffee yields by 20% within 1 kilometer of the forest (as well as increasing the quality of the coffee). During 200003, pollination services from two forest fragments (of 46 and 111 hectares) thus increased the income of a 1,100-hectare farm by $60,000 a year, a value commensurate with expected revenues from competing land uses.  Flood control: Muthurajawela Marsh, a 3,100-hectare coastal peat bog in Sri Lanka, provides an estimated $5 million in annual benefits ($1,750 per hectare) through its role in local flood control.  The total economic value associated with managing ecosystems more sustainably is often higher than the value associated with the conversion of the ecosystem through farming, clear-cut logging, or other intensive uses. Relatively few studies have compared the total economic value (including values of both marketed and nonmarketed ecosystem services) of ecosystems under alternate management regimes, but a number of studies that do exist have found that the benefit of managing the ecosystem more sustainably exceeded that of converting the ecosystem (see Figure 3.3), although the private benefitsthat is, the actual monetary benefits captured from the services entering the marketwould favor conversion or unsustainable management. These studies are consistent with the understanding that market failures associated with ecosystem services lead to greater conversion of ecosystems than is economically justified. However, this finding would not hold at all locations.

For each MDG, governments have agreed to between 1 and 8 targets that are to be achieved by 2015. Slowing or reversing the degradation of ecosystem services will contribute significantly to the achievement of many of the MDGs.  Poverty Eradication. Ecosystem services are a dominant influence on livelihoods of most poor people. Most of the worlds poorest people live in rural areas and are thus highly dependent, directly or indirectly, on the ecosystem service of food production, including agriculture, livestock, and hunting. Mismanagement of ecosystems threatens the livelihood of poor people and may threaten their survival. Poor people are highly vulnerable to changes in watershed services that affect the quality or availability of water, loss of ecosystems such as wetlands, mangroves, or coral reefs that affect the likelihood of flood or storm damage, or changes in climate regulating services that might alter regional climate. Ecosystem degradation is often one of the factors trapping people in cycles of poverty.  Hunger Eradication. Although economic and social factors are often the primary determinants of hunger, food production remains an important factor, particularly among the rural poor. Food production is an ecosystem service in its own right, and it also depends on watershed services, pollination, pest regulation, and soil formation. Food production needs to increase to meet the needs of the growing human population, and at the same time the efficiency of food production needs to increase in order to reduce harm to other key ecosystem services. Ecosystem condition, in particular climate, soil degradation, and water availability, influences progress toward this goal through its influence on crop yields as well as through impacts on the availability of wild sources of food.  Reducing Child Mortality. Undernutrition is the underlying cause of a substantial proportion of all child deaths. Child mortality is also strongly influenced by diseases associ- ated with water quality. Diarrhea is one of the predominant causes of infant deaths worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria additionally plays an important part in child mortality in many countries of the region.  Combating Disease. Human health is strongly influenced by ecosystem services related to food production, water quality, water quantity, and natural hazard regulation, and the role of ecosystem management is central to addressing some of the most pressing global diseases such as malaria. Changes in ecosystems influence the abundance of human pathogens such as malaria and cholera as well as the risk of emergence of new diseases. Malaria is responsible for 11% of the disease burden in Africa, and it is estimated that Africas GDP could have been $100 billion larger in 2000 if malaria had been eliminated 35 years ago.

Collectively these factors influence the level of production and consumption of ecosystem services and the sustainability of production. Both economic growth and population growth lead to increased consumption of ecosystem services, although the harmful environmental impacts of any particular level of consumption depend on the efficiency of the technologies used in the production of the service. These factors interact in complex ways in different locations to change pressures on ecosystems and uses of ecosystem services. Driving forces are almost always multiple and interactive, so that a one-to-one linkage between particular driving forces and particular changes in ecosystems rarely exists. Even so, changes in any one of these indirect drivers generally result in changes in ecosystems. The causal linkage is almost always highly mediated by other factors, thereby complicating statements of causality or attempts to establish the proportionality of various contributors to changes. There are five major indirect drivers:  Demographic Drivers: Global population doubled in the past 40 years and increased by 2 billion people in the last 25 years, reaching 6 billion in 2000. Developing countries have accounted for most recent population growth in the past quartercentury, but there is now an unprecedented diversity of demographic patterns across regions and countries. Some high-income countries such as the United States are still experiencing high rates of population growth, while some developing countries such as China, Thailand, and North and South Korea have very low rates. In the United States, high population growth is due primarily to high levels of immigration. About half the people in the world now live in urban areas, up from less than 15% at the start of the twentieth century. High-income countries typically have populations that are 7080% urban. Some developing-country regions, such as parts of Asia, are still largely rural, while Latin America, at 75% urban, is indistinguishable from high-income countries in this regard.  Economic Drivers: Global economic activity increased nearly sevenfold between 1950 and 2000. With rising per capita income, the demand for many ecosystem services grows. At the same time, the structure of consumption changes. In the case of food, for example, as income grows the share of additional income spent on food declines, the importance of starchy staples declines, diets include more fat, meat and fish, and fruits and vegetables, and the proportionate consumption of industrial goods and services rises.", "raw_text": "Indirect Drivers In the aggregate and at a global scale, there are five indirect drivers of changes in ecosystems and their services: population change, change in economic activity, sociopolitical factors, cultural factors, and technological change. Collectively these factors influence the level of production and consumption of ecosystem services and the sustainability of production. Both economic growth and population growth lead to increased consumption of ecosystem services, although the harmful environmental impacts of any particular level of consumption depend on the efficiency of the technologies used in the production of the service. These factors interact in complex ways in different locations to change pressures on ecosystems and uses of ecosystem services. Driving forces are almost always multiple and interactive, so that a one-to-one linkage between particular driving forces and particular changes in ecosystems rarely exists. Even so, changes in any one of these indirect drivers generally result in changes in ecosystems. The causal linkage is almost always highly mediated by other factors, thereby complicating statements of causality or attempts to establish the proportionality of various contributors to changes. There are five major indirect drivers:  Demographic Drivers: Global population doubled in the past 40 years and increased by 2 billion people in the last 25 years, reaching 6 billion in 2000 (S7.2.1). Developing countries have accounted for most recent population growth in the past quartercentury, but there is now an unprecedented diversity of demographic patterns across regions and countries. Some high-income countries such as the United States are still experiencing high rates of population growth, while some developing countries such as China, Thailand, and North and South Korea have very low rates. In the United States, high population growth is due primarily to high levels of immigration. About half the people in the world now live in urban areas (although urban areas cover less than 3% of the terrestrial surface), up from less than 15% at the start of the twentieth century (C27.1). High-income countries typically have populations that are 7080% urban. Some developing-country regions, such as parts of Asia, are still largely rural, while Latin America, at 75% urban, is indistinguishable from high-income countries in this regard (S7.2.1).  Economic Drivers: Global economic activity increased nearly sevenfold between 1950 and 2000 (S7.SDM). With rising per capita income, the demand for many ecosystem services grows. At the same time, the structure of consumption changes. In the case of food, for example, as income grows the share of additional income spent on food declines, the importance of starchy staples (such as rice, wheat, and potatoes) declines, diets include more fat, meat and fish, and fruits and vegetables, and the proportionate consumption of industrial goods and services rises (S7.2.2).", "sentences": [{"id":

Broad comparisons of whole cultures have not proved useful because they ignore vast variations in values, beliefs, and norms within cultures.

Fish populations are generally able to withstand some level of catch with a relatively small impact on their overall population size. As the catch increases, however, a threshold is reached after which too few adults remain to produce enough offspring to support that level of harvest, and the population may drop abruptly to a much smaller size. For example, the Atlantic cod stocks of the east coast of Newfoundland collapsed in 1992, forcing the closure of the fishery after hundreds of years of exploitation, as shown in Figure 3.4. Most important, the stocks may take years to recover or not recover at all, even if harvesting is significantly reduced or eliminated entirely.  Species introductions and losses: Introductions of species can cause nonlinear changes in ecosystems and their services. For example, the introduction of the zebra mussel into U.S. aquatic systems resulted in the extirpation of native clams in Lake St. Clair, large changes in energy flow and ecosystem function, and annual costs of $100 million to the power industry and other users. The introduction of the comb jelly fish in the Black Sea caused the loss of 26 major fisheries species and has been implicated in subsequent growth of the anoxic dead zone. The loss of the sea otters from many coastal ecosystems on the Pacific Coast of North America due to hunting led to the booming populations of sea urchins which in turn led to the loss of kelp forests.  Changes in dominant species in coral ecosystems: Some coral reef ecosystems have undergone sudden shifts from coral-dominated to algae-dominated reefs. The trigger for such phase shifts, which are essentially irreversible, is usually multifaceted and includes increased nutrient input leading to eutrophic conditions, and removal of herbivorous fishes that maintain the balance between corals and algae. Once a threshold is reached, the change in the ecosystem takes place within months and the resulting ecosystem, although stable, is less productive and less diverse. One well-studied example is the sudden switch in 1983 from coral to algal domination of Jamaican reef systems. This followed several centuries of overfishing of herbivores, which left the control of algal cover almost entirely dependent on a single species of sea urchin, whose populations collapsed when exposed to a species-specific pathogen. As a result, Jamaicas reefs shifted to a new low-diversity, algae-dominated state with very limited capacity to support fisheries.

As the catch increases, however, a threshold is reached after which too few adults remain to produce enough offspring to support that level of harvest, and the population may drop abruptly to a much smaller size. For example, the Atlantic cod stocks of the east coast of Newfoundland collapsed in 1992, forcing the closure of the fishery after hundreds of years of exploitation, as shown in Figure 3.4 (CF2 Box 2.4). Most important, the stocks may take years to recover or not recover at all, even if harvesting is significantly reduced or eliminated entirely.  Species introductions and losses: Introductions (or removal) of species can cause nonlinear changes in ecosystems and their services. For example, the introduction of the zebra mussel (see photo above) into U.S. aquatic systems resulted in the extirpation of native clams in Lake St. Clair, large changes in energy flow and ecosystem function, and annual costs of $100 million to the power industry and other users (S12.4.8). The introduction of the comb jelly fish (Mnemiopsis leidyi) in the Black Sea caused the loss of 26 major fisheries species and has been implicated (along with other factors) in subsequent growth of the anoxic dead zone (C28.5). The loss of the sea otters from many coastal ecosystems on the Pacific Coast of North America due to hunting led to the booming populations of sea urchins (a prey species for otters) which in turn led to the loss of kelp forests (which are eaten by urchins).  Changes in dominant species in coral ecosystems: Some coral reef ecosystems have undergone sudden shifts from coral-dominated to algae-dominated reefs. The trigger for such phase shifts, which are essentially irreversible, is usually multifaceted and includes increased nutrient input leading to eutrophic conditions, and removal of herbivorous fishes that maintain the balance between corals and algae. Once a threshold is reached, the change in the ecosystem takes place within months and the resulting ecosystem, although stable, is less productive and less diverse. One well-studied example is the sudden switch in 1983 from coral to algal domination of Jamaican reef systems. This followed several centuries of overfishing of herbivores, which left the control of algal cover almost entirely dependent on a single species of sea urchin, whose populations collapsed when exposed to a species-specific pathogen. As a result, Jamaicas reefs shifted (apparently irreversibly) to a new low-diversity, algae-dominated state with very limited capacity to support fisheries (C4.6).

Water withdrawals began to decline in many parts of the OECD at the end of the twentieth century, and with medium certainty will continue to decline throughout the OECD during the twenty-first century because of saturation of per capita demands, efficiency improvements, and stabilizing populations.  Water withdrawals are expected to increase greatly outside the OECD as a result of economic development and population growth. The extent of these increases is very scenario-dependent. In sub-Saharan Africa, domestic water use greatly increases and this implies an increased access to fresh water. However, the technical and economic feasibility of increasing domestic water withdrawals is very uncertain.
