Humans have made unprecedented changes to ecosystems in recent decades to meet growing demands for food, fresh water, fiber, and energy.  These changes have helped to improve the lives of billions, but at the same time they weakened natures ability to deliver other key services such as purification of air and water, protection from disasters, and the provision of medicines.  Among the outstanding problems identified by this assessment are the dire state of many of the worlds fish stocks; the intense vulnerability of the 2 billion people living in dry regions to the loss of ecosystem services, including water supply; and the growing threat to ecosystems from climate change and nutrient pollution.  Human activities have taken the planet to the edge of a massive wave of species extinctions, further threatening our own well-being.  The loss of services derived from ecosystems is a significant barrier to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals to reduce poverty, hunger, and disease.  The pressures on ecosystems will increase globally in coming decades unless human attitudes and actions change.  Measures to conserve natural resources are more likely to succeed if local communities are given ownership of them, share the benefits, and are involved in decisions.  Even todays technology and knowledge can reduce considerably the human impact on ecosystems. They are unlikely to be deployed fully, however, until ecosystem services cease to be perceived as free and limitless, and their full value is taken into account.  Better protection of natural assets will require coordinated efforts across all sections of governments, businesses, and international institutions. The productivity of ecosystems depends on policy choices on investment, trade, subsidy, taxation, and regulation, among others."

An ecosystem is a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorganism communities and the nonliving environment interacting as a functional unit. The MA deals with the full range of ecosystemsfrom those relatively undisturbed, such as natural forests, to landscapes with mixed patterns of human use, to ecosystems intensively managed and modified by humans, such as agricultural land and urban areas. Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning services such as food, water, timber, and fiber; regulating services that affect climate, floods, disease, wastes, and water quality; cultural services that provide recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits; and supporting services such as soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling. (See Figure A.) The human species, while buffered against environmental changes by culture and technology, is fundamentally dependent on the flow of ecosystem services."

Human well-being is assumed to have multiple constituents, including the basic material for a good life, such as secure and adequate livelihoods, enough food at all times, shelter, clothing, and access to goods; health, including feeling well and having a healthy physical environment, such as clean air and access to clean water; good social relations, including social cohesion, mutual respect, and the ability to help others and provide for children; security, including secure access to natural and other resources, personal safety, and security from natural and human-made disasters; and freedom of choice and action, including the opportunity to achieve what an individual values doing and being. Freedom of choice and action is influenced by other constituents of well-being (as well as by other factors, notably education) and is also a precondition for achieving other components of well-being, particularly with respect to equity and fairness."

(See Figure B.) At the same time, social, economic, and cultural factors unrelated to ecosystems alter the human condition, and many natural forces influence ecosystems. Although the MA emphasizes the linkages between ecosystems and human well-being, it recognizes that the actions people take that influence ecosystems result not just from concern about human well-being but also from considerations of the intrinsic value of species and ecosystems. Intrinsic value is the value of something in and for itself, irrespective of its utility for someone else."

It incorporates knowledge held by the private sector, practitioners, local communities, and indigenous peoples. The MA did not aim to generate new primary knowledge, but instead sought to add value to existing information by collating, evaluating, summarizing, interpreting, and communicating it in a useful form. Assessments like this one apply the judgment of experts to existing knowledge to provide scientifically credible answers to policy-relevant questions. The focus on policy-relevant questions and the explicit use of expert judgment distinguish this type of assessment from a scientific review."

(For example, if it is possible to purchase a substitute for a degraded ecosystem service, then there is a high potential for mediation.) The strength of the linkages and the potential for mediation differ in different ecosystems and regions. In addition to the influence of ecosystem services on human well-being depicted here, other factorsincluding other environmental factors as well as economic, social, technological, and cultural factorsinfluence human well-being, and ecosystems are in turn affected by changes in human well-being.

These result in changes to ecosystems and the services they provide (lower left corner), thereby affecting human well-being. These interactions can take place at more than one scale and can cross scales. For example, an international demand for timber may lead to a regional loss of forest cover, which increases flood magnitude along a local stretch of a river. Similarly, the interactions can take place across different time scales. Different strategies and interventions can be applied at many points in this framework to enhance human well-being and conserve ecosystems."

What are plausible future changes in ecosystems and their ecosystem services and the consequent changes in human well-being?  What can be done to enhance well-being and conserve ecosystems? What are the strengths and weaknesses of response options that can be considered to realize or avoid specific futures?  What are the key uncertainties that hinder effective decision-making concerning ecosystems?  What tools and methodologies developed and used in the MA can strengthen capacity to assess ecosystems, the services they provide, their impacts on human well-being, and the strengths and weaknesses of response options? The MA was conducted as a multiscale assessment, with interlinked assessments undertaken at local, watershed, national, regional, and global scales. A global ecosystem assessment cannot easily meet all the needs of decision-makers at national and sub-national scales because the management of any particular ecosystem must be tailored to the particular characteristics of that ecosystem and to the demands placed on it. However, an assessment focused only on a particular ecosystem or particular nation is insufficient because some processes are global and because local goods, services, matter, and energy are often transferred across regions. Each of the component assessments was guided by the MA conceptual framework and benefited from the presence of assessments undertaken at larger and smaller scales. The sub-global assessments were not intended to serve as representative samples of all ecosystems; rather, they were to meet the needs of decision-makers at the scales at which they were undertaken."

At the global scale, the Condition and Trends Working Group assessed the state of knowledge on ecosystems, drivers of ecosystem change, ecosystem services, and associated human well-being around the year 2000. The assessment aimed to be comprehensive with regard to ecosystem services, but its coverage is not exhaustive. The Scenarios Working Group considered the possible evolution of ecosystem services during the twenty-first century by developing four global scenarios exploring plausible future changes in drivers, ecosystems, ecosystem services, and human well-being. The Responses Working Group examined the strengths and weaknesses of various response options that have been used to manage ecosystem services and identified promising opportunities for improving human well-being while conserving ecosystems. The report of the Sub-global Assessments Working Group contains lessons learned from the MA sub-global assessments.

The latter group, which involved 80 experts, oversaw the scientific review of the MA reports by governments and experts and ensured that all review comments were appropriately addressed by the authors. All MA findings underwent two rounds of expert and governmental review. Review comments were received from approximately 850 individuals (of which roughly 250 were submitted by authors of other chapters in the MA), although in a number of cases (particularly in the case of governments and MA-affiliated scientific organizations), people submitted collated comments that had been prepared by a number of reviewers in their governments or institutions."

Because of the broad scope of the MA and the complexity of the interactions between social and natural systems, it proved to be difficult to provide definitive information for some of the issues addressed in the MA. Relatively few ecosystem services have been the focus of research and monitoring and, as a consequence, research findings and data are often inadequate for a detailed global assessment. Moreover, the data and information that are available are generally related to either the characteristics of the ecological system or the characteristics of the social system, not to the all-important interactions between these systems. Finally, the scientific and assessment tools and models available to undertake a cross-scale integrated assessment and to project future changes in ecosystem services are only now being developed. Despite these challenges, the MA was able to provide considerable information relevant to most of the focal questions. And by identifying gaps in data and information that prevent policy-relevant questions from being answered, the assessment can help to guide research and monitoring that may allow those questions to be answered in future assessments."

The full costs of the loss and degradation of these ecosystem services are difficult to measure, but the available evidence demonstrates that they are substantial and growing. Many ecosystem services have been degraded as a consequence of actions taken to increase the supply of other services, such as food. These trade-offs often shift the costs of degradation from one group of people to another or defer costs to future generations.  Second, there is established but incomplete evidence that changes being made in ecosystems are increasing the likelihood of nonlinear changes in ecosystems (including accelerating, abrupt, and potentially irreversible changes) that have important consequences for human well-being. Examples of such changes include disease emergence, abrupt alterations in water quality, the creation of dead zones in coastal waters, the collapse of fisheries, and shifts in regional climate."

This has resulted in a substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.  The changes that have been made to ecosystems have contributed to substantial net gains in human well-being and economic development, but these gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of the degradation of many ecosystem services, increased risks of nonlinear changes, and the exacerbation of poverty for some groups of people. These problems, unless addressed, will substantially diminish the benefits that future generations obtain from ecosystems.  The degradation of ecosystem services could grow significantly worse during the first half of this century and is a barrier to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  The challenge of reversing the degradation of ecosystems while meeting increasing demands for their services can be partially met under some scenarios that the MA has considered, but these involve significant changes in policies, institutions, and practices that are not currently under way. Many options exist to conserve or enhance specific ecosystem services in ways that reduce negative trade-offs or that provide positive synergies with other ecosystem services."

This is not to say that ecosystem changes such as increased food production have not also helped to lift many people out of poverty or hunger, but these changes have harmed other individuals and communities, and their plight has been largely overlooked. In all regions, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, the condition and management of ecosystem services is a dominant factor influencing prospects for reducing poverty."

More generally, any progress achieved in addressing the MDGs of poverty and hunger eradication, improved health, and environmental sustainability is unlikely to be sustained if most of the ecosystem services on which humanity relies continue to be degraded. In contrast, the sound management of ecosystem services provides cost-effective opportunities for addressing multiple development goals in a synergistic manner."

Past actions to slow or reverse the degradation of ecosystems have yielded significant benefits, but these improvements have generally not kept pace with growing pressures and demands. Nevertheless, there is tremendous scope for action to reduce the severity of these problems in the coming decades. Indeed, three of four detailed scenarios examined by the MA suggest that significant changes in policies, institutions, and practices can mitigate some but not all of the negative consequences of growing pressures on ecosystems. But the changes required are substantial and are not currently under way."

Cultivated systems (areas where at least 30% of the landscape is in croplands, shifting cultivation, confined livestock production, or freshwater aquaculture) now cover one quarter of Earths terrestrial surface. (See Figure 1.) Areas of rapid change in forest land cover and land degradation are shown in Figure 2.  Approximately 20% of the worlds coral reefs were lost and an additional 20% degraded in the last several decades of the twentieth century, and approximately 35% of mangrove area was lost during this time (in countries for which sufficient data exist, which encompass about half of the area of mangroves).  The amount of water impounded behind dams quadrupled since 1960, and three to six times as much water is held in reservoirs as in natural rivers. Water withdrawals from rivers and lakes doubled since 1960; most water use (70% worldwide) is for agriculture.  Since 1960, flows of reactive (biologically available) nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems have doubled, and flows of phosphorus have tripled.

Ecosystem services that have been degraded over the past 50 years include capture fisheries, water supply, waste treatment and detoxification, water purification, natural hazard protection, regulation of air quality, regulation of regional and local climate, regulation of erosion, spiritual fulfillment, and aesthetic enjoyment. The use of two ecosystem servicescapture fisheries and fresh wateris now well beyond levels that can be sustained even at current demands, much less future ones.

Similarly, the conversion of forest to agriculture can significantly change the frequency and magnitude of floods, although the nature of this impact depends on the characteristics of the local ecosystem and the type of land cover change."

[3, 6] The information available to assess the consequences of changes in ecosystem services for human well-being is relatively limited. Many ecosystem services have not been monitored, and it is also difficult to estimate the influence of changes in ecosystem services relative to other social, cultural, and economic factors that also affect human well-being. Nevertheless, the following types of evidence demonstrate that the harmful effects of the degradation of ecosystem services on livelihoods, health, and local and national economies are substantial.  Most resource management decisions are most strongly influenced by ecosystem services entering markets; as a result, the nonmarketed benefits are often lost or degraded. These nonmarketed benefits are often high and sometimes more valuable than the marketed ones. For example, one of the most comprehensive studies to date, which examined the marketed and nonmarketed economic values associated with forests in eight Mediterranean countries, found that timber and fuelwood generally accounted for less than a third of total economic value of forests in each country. (See Figure 8.) Values associated with non-wood forest products, recreation, hunting, watershed protection, carbon sequestration, and passive use (values independent of direct uses) accounted for between 25% and 96% of the total economic value of the forests.  The total economic value associated with managing ecosystems more sustainably is often higher than the value associated with the conversion of the ecosystem through farming, clear-cut logging, or other intensive uses. Relatively few studies have compared the total economic value (including values of both marketed and nonmarketed ecosystem services) of ecosystems under alternate management regimes, but some of the studies that do exist have found that the benefit of managing the ecosystem more sustainably exceeded that of converting the ecosystem. (See Figure 9.)  The economic and public health costs associated with damage to ecosystem services can be substantial.  The early 1990s collapse of the Newfoundland cod fishery due to overfishing resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and cost at least $2 billion in income support and retraining.  In 1996, the cost of U.K. agriculture resulting from the damage that agricultural practices cause to water (pollution and eutrophication, a process whereby excessive plant growth depletes oxygen in the water), air (emissions of greenhouse gases), soil (off-site erosion damage, emissions"

Similarly, the damage costs of freshwater eutrophication alone in England and Wales (involving factors including reduced value of waterfront dwellings, water treatment costs, reduced recreational value of water bodies, and tourism losses) was estimated to be $105160 million per year in the 1990s, with an additional $77 million a year being spent to address those damages.  The incidence of diseases of marine organisms and the emergence of new pathogens is increasing, and some of these, such as ciguatera, harm human health. Episodes of harmful (including toxic) algal blooms in coastal waters are increasing in frequency and intensity, harming other marine resources such as fisheries as well as human health. In a particularly severe outbreak in Italy in 1989, harmful algal blooms cost the coastal aquaculture industry $10 million and the Italian tourism industry $11.4 million.  The frequency and impact of floods and fires has increased significantly in the past 50 years, in part due to ecosystem changes. Examples are the increased susceptibility of coastal populations to tropical storms when mangrove forests are cleared and the increase in downstream flooding that followed land use changes in the upper Yangtze River. Annual economic losses from extreme events increased tenfold from the 1950s to approximately $70 billion in 2003, of which natural catastrophes (floods, fires, storms, drought, earthquakes) accounted for 84% of insured losses.  The impact of the loss of cultural services is particularly difficult to measure, but it is especially important for many people. Human cultures, knowledge systems, religions, and social interactions have been strongly influenced by ecosystems. A number of the MA sub-global assessments found that spiritual and cultural values of ecosystems were as important as other services for many local communities, both in developing countries (the importance of sacred groves of forest in India, for example) and industrial ones (the importance of urban parks, for instance)."

As a result, a country could cut its forests and deplete its fisheries, and this would show only as a positive gain in GDP (a measure of current economic well-being) without registering the corresponding decline in assets (wealth) that is the more appropriate measure of future economic wellbeing.

[3] Agriculture, fisheries, and forestry once formed the bulk of national economies, and the control of natural resources dominated policy agendas. But while these natural resource industries are often still important, the relative economic and political significance of other industries in industrial countries has grown over the past century as a result of the ongoing transition from agricultural to industrial and service economies, urbanization, and the development of new technologies to increase the production of some services and provide substitutes for others. Nevertheless, the degradation of ecosystem services influences human well-being in industrial regions and among wealthy populations in developing countries in many ways:  The physical, economic, or social impacts of ecosystem service degradation may cross boundaries. (See Figure 10.) For example, land degradation and associated dust storms or fires in one country can degrade air quality in other countries nearby.  Degradation of ecosystem services exacerbates poverty in developing countries, which can affect neighboring industrial countries by slowing regional economic growth and contributing to the outbreak of conflicts or the migration of refugees.  Changes in ecosystems that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate changes that affect all countries.  Many industries still depend directly on ecosystem services. The collapse of fisheries, for example, has harmed many communities in industrial countries. Prospects for the forest, agriculture, fishing, and ecotourism industries are all directly tied to ecosystem services, while other sectors such as insurance, banking, and health are strongly, if less directly, influenced by changes in ecosystem services.  Wealthy populations of people are insulated from the harmful effects of some aspects of ecosystem degradation, but not all. For example, substitutes are typically not available when cultural services are lost.  Even though the relative economic importance of agriculture, fisheries, and forestry is declining in industrial countries, the importance of other ecosystem services such as aesthetic enjoyment and recreational options is growing."

[7] Substantial inertia (delay in the response of a system to a disturbance) exists in ecological systems. As a result, long time lags often occur between a change in a driver and the time when the full consequences of that change become apparent. For example, phosphorus is accumulating in large quantities in many agricultural soils, threatening rivers, lakes, and coastal oceans with increased eutrophication. But it may take years or decades for the full impact of the phosphorus to become apparent through erosion and other processes. Similarly, it will take centuries for global temperatures to reach equilibrium with changed concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and even more time for biological systems to respond to the changes in climate."

For example, changes in upstream catchments affect water flow and water quality in downstream regions; similarly, the loss of an important fish nursery area in a coastal wetland may diminish fish catch some distance away. Both the inertia in ecological systems and the temporal and spatial separation of costs and benefits of ecosystem changes often result in situations where the individuals experiencing harm from ecosystem changes (future generations, say, or downstream landowners) are not the same as the individuals gaining the benefits. These temporal and spatial patterns make it extremely difficult to fully assess costs and benefits associated with ecosystem changes or to attribute costs and benefits to different stakeholders. Moreover, the institutional arrangements now in place to manage ecosystems are poorly designed to cope with these challenges."

And these nonlinear changes are sometimes abrupt; they can also be large in magnitude and difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse. Capabilities for predicting some nonlinear changes are improving, but for most ecosystems and for most potential nonlinear changes, while science can often warn of increased risks of change it cannot predict the thresholds at which the change will be encountered. Examples of largemagnitude nonlinear changes include:  Disease emergence. If, on average, each infected person infects at least one other person, then an epidemic spreads, while if the infection is transferred on average to less than one person, the epidemic dies out. During the 199798 El Nino, excessive flooding caused cholera epidemics in Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. Warming of the African Great Lakes due to climate change may create conditions that increase the risk of cholera transmission in the surrounding countries.  Eutrophication and hypoxia. Once a threshold of nutrient loading is achieved, changes in freshwater and coastal ecosystems can be abrupt and extensive, creating harmful algal blooms (including blooms of toxic species) and sometimes leading to the formation of oxygen-depleted zones, killing most animal life."

This could place them at risk of extinction and also reduce the food supply of people dependent on these resources in the longer term. At the same time, the bushmeat trade involves relatively high levels of interaction between humans and some relatively closely related wild animals that are eaten.

For several reasons, groups such as the poor, women, and indigenous communities have tended to be harmed by these changes.  Many changes in ecosystem management have involved the privatization of what were formerly common pool resources. Individuals who depended on those resources (such as indigenous peoples, forest-dependent communities, and other groups relatively marginalized from political and economic sources of power) have often lost rights to the resources.  Some of the people and places affected by changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services are highly vulnerable and poorly equipped to cope with the major changes in ecosystems that may occur. Highly vulnerable groups include those whose needs for ecosystem services already exceed the supply, such as people lacking adequate clean water supplies, and people living in areas with declining per capita agricultural production.  Significant differences between the roles and rights of men and women in many societies lead to increased vulnerability of women to changes in ecosystem services.  The reliance of the rural poor on ecosystem services is rarely measured and thus typically overlooked in national statistics and poverty assessments, resulting in inappropriate strategies that do not take into account the role of the environment in poverty reduction. For example, a recent study that synthesized data from 17 countries found that 22% of household income for rural communities in forested regions comes from sources typically not included in national statistics, such as harvesting wild food, fuelwood, fodder, medicinal plants, and timber. These activities generated a much higher proportion of poorer families total income than of wealthy families, and this income was of particular significance in periods of both predictable and unpredictable shortfalls in other livelihood sources."

These pressures continue to grow in all the MA scenarios.  Invasive alien species: The spread of invasive alien species and disease organisms continues to increase because of both deliberate translocations and accidental introductions related to growing trade and travel, with significant harmful consequences to native species and many ecosystem services.  Pollution, particularly nutrient loading: Humans have already doubled the flow of reactive nitrogen on the continents, and some projections suggest that this may increase by roughly a further two thirds by 2050. (See Figure 14.) Three out of four MA scenarios project that the global flux of nitrogen to coastal ecosystems will increase by a further 1020% by 2030 (medium certainty), with almost all of this increase occurring in developing countries. Excessive flows of nitrogen contribute to eutrophication of freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems and acidification of freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems (with implications for biodiversity in these ecosystems). To some degree, nitrogen also plays a role in creation of ground-level ozone (which leads to loss of agricultural and forest productivity), destruction of ozone in the stratosphere (which leads to depletion of the ozone layer and increased UV-B radiation on Earth, causing increased incidence of skin cancer), and climate change. The resulting health effects include the consequences of ozone pollution on asthma and respiratory function, increased allergies and asthma due to increased pollen production, the risk of blue-baby syndrome,"

The role of ecosystem changes in exacerbating poverty (Goal 1, Target 1) for some groups of people has been described already, and the goal of environmental sustainability, including access to safe drinking water (Goal 7, Targets 9, 10, and 11), cannot be achieved as long as most ecosystem services are being degraded. Progress toward three other MDGs is particularly dependent on sound ecosystem management:  Hunger (Goal 1, Target 2): All four MA scenarios project progress in the elimination of hunger but at rates far slower than needed to attain the internationally agreed target of halving, between 1990 and 2015, the share of people suffering from hunger. Moreover, the improvements are slowest in the regions in which the problems are greatest: South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Ecosystem condition, in particular climate, soil degradation, and water availability, influences progress toward this goal through its effect on crop yields as well as through impacts on the availability of wild sources of food.  Child mortality (Goal 4): Undernutrition is the underlying cause of a substantial proportion of all child deaths. Three of the MA scenarios project reductions in child undernourishment by 2050 of between 10% and 60% but undernourishment increases by 10% in Order from Strength (low certainty). Child mortality is also strongly influenced by diseases associated with water quality. Diarrhea is one of the predominant causes of infant deaths worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria additionally plays an important part in child mortality in many countries of the region.  Disease (Goal 6): In the more promising MA scenarios, progress toward Goal 6 is achieved, but under Order from Strength it is plausible that health and social conditions for the North and South could further diverge, exacerbating health problems in many low-income regions. Changes in ecosystems influence the abundance of human pathogens such as malaria and cholera as well as the risk of emergence of new diseases. Malaria is responsible for 11% of the disease burden in Africa, and it is estimated that Africas GDP could have been $100 billion larger in 2000 (roughly a 25% increase) if malaria had been eliminated 35 years ago. The prevalence of the following infectious diseases is particularly strongly influenced by ecosystem change: malaria, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, Japanese encephalitis, dengue fever, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, meningitis, cholera, West Nile virus, and Lyme disease."

But while the availability of substitutes can reduce pressure on specific ecosystem services, they may not always have positive net benefits on the environment.

Government subsidies paid to the agricultural sectors of OECD countries between 2001 and 2003 averaged over $324 billion annually, or one third the global value of agricultural products in 2000. A significant proportion of this total involved production subsidies that led to greater food production in industrial countries than the global market conditions warranted, promoted overuse of fertilizers and pesticides in those countries, and reduced the profitability of agriculture in developing countries. Many countries outside the OECD also have inappropriate input and production subsidies, and inappropriate subsidies are common in other sectors such as water, fisheries, and forestry. Although removal of perverse subsidies will produce net benefits, it will not be without costs.

Cultivated systems provide only 16% of global runoff, although their close proximity to humans means that about 5 billion people depend for all or some of their water on supplies from cultivated systems (C7 Table 7.2). Such proximity is associated with nutrient and industrial water pollution."

Factors contributing to the growth of the role of ecosystems in carbon sequestration include afforestation, reforestation, and forest management in North America, Europe, China, and other regions; changed agriculture practices; and the fertilizing effects of nitrogen deposition and increasing atmospheric CO2 (high certainty) (C13.ES).  Nitrogen Cycle: The total amount of reactive, or biologically available, nitrogen created by human activities increased ninefold between 1890 and 1990, with most of that increase taking place in the second half of the century in association with increased use of fertilizers (S7.3.2). (See Figures 1.5 and 1.6.) A recent study of global human contributions to reactive nitrogen flows projected that flows will increase from approximately 165 teragrams of reactive nitrogen in 1999 to 270 teragrams in 2050, an increase of 64% (R9 Fig 9.1). More than half of all the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer (which was first produced in 1913) ever used on the planet has been used since 1985 (R9.2). Human activities have now roughly doubled the rate of creation of reactive nitrogen on the land surfaces of Earth (R9.2). The flux of reactive nitrogen to the oceans increased by nearly 80% from 1860 to 1990, from roughly 27 teragrams of nitrogen per year to 48 teragrams in 1990 (R9). (This change is not uniform over Earth, however, and while some regions such as Labrador and Hudsons Bay in Canada have seen little if any change, the fluxes from more developed regions such as the northeastern United States, the watersheds of the North Sea in Europe, and the Yellow River basin in China have increased tento fifteenfold.)  Phosphorus Cycle: The use of phosphorus fertilizers and the rate of phosphorus accumulation in agricultural soils increased nearly threefold between 1960 and 1990, although the rate has declined somewhat since that time (S7 Fig 7.18).

First, the extinction of species or the loss of populations results in the loss of the presence of species that had been unique to particular regions. Second, the rate of invasion or introduction of species into new ranges is already high and continues to accelerate apace with growing trade and faster transportation. (See Figure 1.7.) For example, a high proportion of the roughly 100 non-native species in the Baltic Sea are native to the North American Great Lakes, and 75% of the recent arrivals of about 170 non-native species in the Great Lakes are native to the Baltic Sea (S10.5). When species decline or go extinct as a result of human activities, they are replaced by a much smaller number of expanding species that thrive in human-altered environments. One effect is that in some regions where diversity has been low, the biotic diversity may actually increasea result of invasions of non-native forms.

Specialists on these groups have categorized species as threatened with extinction if they meet a set of quantitative criteria involving their population size, the size of area in which they are found, and trends in population size or area. (Under the widely used IUCN criteria for extinction, the vast majority of species categorized as threatened with extinction have approximately a 10% chance of going extinct within 100 years, although some long-lived species will persist much longer even though their small population size and lack of recruitment means that they have a very high likelihood of extinction.) Twelve percent of bird species, 23% of mammals, and 25% of conifers are currently threatened with extinction; 32% of amphibians are threatened with extinction, but information is more limited and this may be an underestimate.

Two other services (fuelwood and fiber) show mixed patterns. The use of some types of fiber is increasing and others decreasing; in the case of fuelwood, there is evidence of a recent peak in use."

Recently, the service of carbon sequestration has been enhanced globally, due in part to the re-growth of forests in temperate regions, although previously deforestation had been a net source of carbon emissions. Half of provisioning services (6 of 11) and nearly 70% (9 of 13) of regulating and cultural services are being degraded or used unsustainably.  Provisioning Services: The quantity of provisioning ecosystem services such as food, water, and timber used by humans increased rapidly, often more rapidly than population growth although generally slower than economic growth, during the second half of the twentieth century. And it continues to grow. In a number of cases, provisioning services are being used at unsustainable rates. The growing human use has been made possible by a combination of substantial increases in the absolute amount of some services produced by ecosystems and an increase in the fraction used by humans. World population doubled between 1960 and 2000, from 3 billion to 6 billion people, and the global economy increased more than sixfold. During this time, food production increased by roughly two-and-a-half times (a 160% increase in food production between 1961 and 2003), water use doubled, wood harvests for pulp and paper tripled, and timber production increased by nearly 60% (C9.ES, C9.2.2, S7, C7.2.3, C8.1).

Between 15% and 35% of irrigation withdrawals exceed supply rates and are therefore unsustainable (low to medium certainty) (C7.2.2). Current agricultural practices are also unsustainable in some regions due to their reliance on unsustainable sources of water, harmful impacts caused by excessive nutrient or pesticide use, salinization, nutrient depletion, and rates of soil loss that exceed rates of soil formation.  Regulating Services: Humans have substantially altered regulating services such as disease and climate regulation by modifying the ecosystem providing the service and, in the case of waste processing services, by exceeding the capabilities of ecosystems to provide the service. Most changes to regulating services are inadvertent results of actions taken to enhance the supply of provisioning services. Humans have substantially modified the climate regulation service of ecosystemsfirst through land use changes that contributed to increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere and more recently by increasing the sequestration of carbon dioxide (although ecosystems remain a net source of methane and nitrous oxide).

Changes to ecosystems have contributed to a significant rise in the number of floods and major wildfires on all continents since the 1940s. Ecosystems serve an important role in detoxifying wastes introduced into the environment, but there are intrinsic limits to that waste processing capability. For example, aquatic ecosystems cleanse on average 80% of their global incident nitrogen loading, but this intrinsic selfpurification capacity varies widely and is being reduced by the loss of wetlands (C7.2.5).  Cultural Services: Although the use of cultural services has continued to grow, the capability of ecosystems to provide cultural benefits has been significantly diminished in the past century (C17). Human cultures are strongly influenced by ecosystems, and ecosystem change can have a significant impact on cultural identity and social stability. Human cultures, knowledge systems, religions, heritage values, social interactions, and the linked amenity services (such as aesthetic enjoyment, recreation, artistic and spiritual fulfillment, and intellectual development) have always been influenced and shaped by the nature of the ecosystem and ecosystem conditions.

Industrial fishing fleets have also shifted to fishing further offshore and in deeper water to meet global demand (C18.ES). (See Figure 2.2.)

The substitution of a variety of other materials for wood (such as vinyl, plastics, and metal) has contributed to relatively slow growth in global timber consumption in recent years (C9.2.1). While the use of substitutes can reduce pressure on specific ecosystem services, this may not always have positive net environmental benefits.

Trade-offs among ecosystem services are commonplace. (See Table 2.2.) For example, actions to increase food production often involve one or more of the following: increased water use, degraded water quality, reduced biodiversity, reduced forest cover, loss of forest products, or release of greenhouse gases. Frequent cultivation, irrigated rice production, livestock production, and burning of cleared areas and crop residues now release 1,600800 million tons of carbon per year in CO2 (C26. ES). Cultivation, irrigated rice production, and livestock production release between 106 million and 201 million tons of carbon per year in methane (C13 Table 13.1). About 70% of anthropogenic nitrous oxide gas emissions are attributable to agriculture, mostly from land conversion and nitrogen fertilizer use (C26. ES). Similarly, the conversion of forest to agriculture can significantly change flood frequency and magnitude, although the amount and direction of this impact is highly dependent on the characteristics of the local ecosystem and the nature of the land cover change (C21.5.2)."

These trade-offs are rarely taken fully into account in decisionmaking, partly due to the sectoral nature of planning and partly because some of the effects are also displaced in time (such as long-term climate impacts)."

The benefits of resource management actions have traditionally been evaluated only from the standpoint of the service targeted by the management intervention. However, management interventions to increase any particular service almost always result in costs to other services. Negative trade-offs are commonly found between individual provisioning services and between provisioning services and the combined regulating, cultural, and supporting services and biodiversity. Taking the costs of these negative trade-offs into account reduces the apparent benefits of the various management interventions. For example:  Expansion of commercial shrimp farming has had serious impacts on ecosystems, including loss of vegetation, deterioration of water quality, decline of capture fisheries, and loss of biodiversity (R6, C19).  Expansion of livestock production around the world has often led to overgrazing and dryland degradation, rangeland fragmentation, loss of wildlife habitat, dust formation, bush encroachment, deforestation, nutrient overload through disposal of manure, and greenhouse gas emissions (R6.ES).  Poorly designed and executed agricultural policies led to an irreversible change in the Aral Sea ecosystem. By 1998, the Aral Sea had lost more than 60% of its area and approximately 80% of its volume, and ecosystem-related problems in the region now include excessive salt content of major rivers, contamination of agricultural products with agrochemicals, high levels of turbidity in major water sources, high levels of pesticides and phenols in surface waters, loss of soil fertility, extinctions of species, and destruction of commercial fisheries (R6 Box 6.9).  Forested riparian wetlands adjacent to the Mississippi river in the United States had the capacity to store about 60 days of river discharge. With the removal of the wetlands through canalization, leveeing, and draining, the remaining wetlands have a storage capacity of less than 12 days discharge, an 80% reduction in flood storage capacity (C16.1.1)."

Agroforestry can meet human needs for food and fuel, restore soils, and contribute to biodiversity conservation. Intercropping can increase yields, increase biocontrol, reduce soil erosion, and reduce weed invasion in fields. Urban parks and other urban green spaces provide spiritual, aesthetic, educational, and recreational benefits as well as such services such as water purification, wildlife habitat, waste management, and carbon sequestration. Protection of natural forests for biodiversity conservation can also reduce carbon emissions and protect water supplies. Protection of wetlands can contribute to flood control and also help to remove pollutants such as phosphorus and nitrogen from the water. For example, it is estimated that the nitrogen load from the heavily polluted Illinois River basin to the Mississippi River could be cut in half by converting 7% of the basin back to wetlands (R9.4.5).

These, too, can be mediated by socioeconomic circumstances, but to a smaller extent. Changes in cultural services have relatively weak linkages to material elements of well-being. Changes in supporting services have a strong influence by virtue of their influence on provisioning and regulating services. The following are some examples of material components of well-being affected by ecosystem change.  Income and Employment: Increased production of crops, fisheries, and forest products has been associated with significant growth in local and national economies. Changes in the use and management of these services can either increase employment (as, for example, when agriculture spreads to new regions) or decrease it through gains in productivity of labor. In regions where productivity has declined due to land degradation or overharvesting of fisheries, the impacts on local economies and employment can be devastating to the poor or to those who rely on these services for income.  Food: The growth in food production and farm productivity has more than kept pace with global population growth, resulting in significant downward pressure on the price of foodstuffs. Following significant spikes in the 1970s caused primarily by oil crises, there have been persistent and profound reductions in the price of foodstuffs globally (C8.1). Over the last 40 years, food prices have dropped by around 40% in real terms due to increases in productivity (C26.2.3). It is well established that past increases in food production, at progressively lower unit cost, have improved the health and well-being of billions, particularly the most needy, who spend the largest share of their incomes on food (C8.1). Increased production of food and lower prices for food have not been entirely positive. Among industrial countries, and increasingly among developing ones, diet-related risks, mainly associated with overnutrition, in combination with physical inactivity now account for one third of the burden of disease (R16.1.2). At present, over 1 billion adults are overweight, with at least 300 million considered clinically obese, up from 200 million in 1995 (C8.5.1).  Water Availability: The modification of rivers and lakes through the construction of dams and diversions has increased the water available for human use in many regions of the world. However, the declining per capita availability of water is having negative impacts on human well-being. Water scarcity is a globally significant and accelerating condition for roughly 12 billion people worldwide, leading to problems with food production, human health, and economic development.

Human health is both a product and a determinant of well-being. Changes in provisioning services such as food, water, medicinal plants, and access to new medicines and changes in regulating services that influence air quality, water quality, disease regulation, and waste treatment also have very strong impacts on health. Changes in cultural services can have strong influences on health, since they affect spiritual, inspirational, aesthetic, and recreational opportunities, and these in turn affect both physical and emotional states. Changes in supporting services have a strong influence on all of the other categories of services. These benefits are moderately mediated by socioeconomic circumstances. The wealthy can purchase substitutes for some health benefits of ecosystems (such as medicinal plants or water quality), but they are more susceptible to changes affecting air quality. The following are some examples of health components of well-being affected by ecosystem change.  Nutrition: In 2000, about a quarter of the burden of disease among the poorest countries was attributable to childhood and maternal undernutrition. Worldwide, undernutrition accounted for nearly 10% of the global burden of disease (R16.1.2).  Water and Sanitation: The burden of disease from inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene totals 1.7 million deaths and results in the loss of at least 54 million healthy life years annually. Along with sanitation, water availability and quality are well recognized as important risk factors for infectious diarrhea and other major diseases. (See Box Table.)

Vector-borne diseases cause approximately 1.4 million deaths a year, mainly due to malaria in Africa. These infections are both an effect and a cause of poverty (R12.ES). Prevalence of a number of infectious diseases appears to be growing, and environmental changes such as deforestation, dam construction, road building, agricultural conversion, and urbanization are contributing factors in many cases (C14.2).  Medicines: The use of natural products in the pharmaceutical industry has tended to fluctuate widely, with a general decline in pharmaceutical bioprospecting by major companies. Historically, most drugs were obtained from natural products. Even near the end of the twentieth century, approximately 50% of prescription medicines were originally discovered in plants (C10.2). Natural products still are actively used in drug exploration. Medicinal plants continue to play an important role in health care systems in many parts of the world. One MA subglobal assessment in the Mekong wetlands identified more than 280 medically important plant species, of which 150 are still in regular use (C10.2.2).

The benefits they provide to society, therefore, are largely unrecorded: only a portion of the total benefits provided by an ecosystem make their way into statistics, and many of these are misattributed (the water regulation benefits of wetlands, for example, do not appear as benefits of wetlands but as higher profits in water-using sectors). Moreover, for ecosystem services that do not pass through markets there is often insufficient incentive for individuals to invest in maintenance (although in some cases common property management systems provide such incentives). Typically, even if individuals are aware of the services provided by an ecosystem, they are neither compensated for providing these services nor penalized for reducing them. These nonmarketed benefits are often high and sometimes more valuable than the marketed benefits. For example:  Total economic value of forests. One of the most comprehen- sive studies to date, which examined the marketed and nonmarketed economic values associated with forests in eight Mediterranean countries, found that timber and fuelwood generally accounted for less than a third of total economic value in each country. (See Figure 3.2.)  Recreational benefits of protected areas: The annual recreational value of the coral reefs of each of six Marine Management Areas in the Hawaiian Islands in 2003 ranged from $300,000 to $35 million.  Water quality: The net present value in 1998 of protecting water quality in the 360-kilometer Catawba River in the United States for five years was estimated to be $346 million.  Water purification service of wetlands: About half of the total economic value of the Danube River Floodplain in 1992 could be accounted for in its role as a nutrient sink.  Native pollinators: A study in Costa Rica found that forestbased pollinators increased coffee yields by 20% within 1 kilometer of the forest (as well as increasing the quality of the coffee). During 200003, pollination services from two forest fragments (of 46 and 111 hectares) thus increased the income of a 1,100-hectare farm by $60,000 a year, a value commensurate with expected revenues from competing land uses.  Flood control: Muthurajawela Marsh, a 3,100-hectare coastal peat bog in Sri Lanka, provides an estimated $5 million in annual benefits ($1,750 per hectare) through its role in local flood control.  The total economic value associated with managing ecosystems more sustainably is often higher than the value associated with the conversion of the ecosystem through farming, clear-cut logging, or other intensive uses. Relatively few studies have compared the total economic value (including values of both marketed and nonmarketed ecosystem services) of ecosystems under alternate management regimes, but a number of studies that do exist have found that the benefit of managing the ecosystem more sustainably exceeded that of converting the ecosystem (see Figure 3.3), although the private benefitsthat is, the actual monetary benefits captured from the services entering the marketwould favor conversion or unsustainable management. These studies are consistent with the understanding that market failures associated with ecosystem services lead to greater conversion of ecosystems than is economically justified. However, this finding would not hold at all locations. For example, the value of conversion of an ecosystem in areas of prime agricultural land or in urban regions often exceeds the total economic value of the intact ecosystem."

The early 1990s collapse of the Newfound- land cod fishery due to overfishing (see Figure 3.4) resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and has cost at least $2 billion in income support and retraining.  The cost of U.K. agriculture in 1996 resulting from the damage that agricultural practices cause to water (pollution, eutrophication), air (emissions of greenhouse gases), soil (off-site erosion damage, carbon dioxide loss), and biodiversity was $2.6 billion, or 9% of average yearly gross farm receipts for the 1990s. Similarly, the damage costs of freshwater eutrophication alone in England and Wales was estimated to be $105160 million per year in the 1990s, with an additional $77 million per year being spent to address those damages.  The burning of 10 million hectares of Indonesias forests in 1997/98 cost an estimated $9.3 billion in increased health care, lost production, and lost tourism revenues and affected some 20 million people across the region.  The total damages for the Indian Ocean region over 20 years (with a 10% discount rate) resulting from the long-term impacts of the massive 1998 coral bleaching episode are estimated to be between $608 million (if there is only a slight decrease in tourismgenerated income and employment results) and $8 billion (if tourism income and employment and fish productivity drop significantly and reefs cease to function as a protective barrier).  The net annual loss of economic value associated with invasive species in the fynbos vegetation of the Cape Floral region of South Africa in 1997 was estimated to be $93.5 million, equivalent to a reduction of the potential economic value without the invasive species of more than 40%. The invasive species have caused losses of biodiversity, water, soil, and scenic beauty, although they also provide some benefits, such as provision of firewood.  The incidence of diseases of marine organisms and emergence of new pathogens is increasing, and some of these, such as ciguatera, harm human health (C19.3.1). Episodes of harmful (including toxic) algal blooms in coastal waters are increasing in frequency and intensity, harming other marine resources such as fisheries and harming human health (R16 Figure 16.3).

Although most or all biodiversity has some economic value (the option value of any species is always greater than zero), that does not mean that the protection of all biodiversity is always economically justified. Other utilitarian benefits often compete with the benefits of maintaining greater diversity. For example, many of the steps taken to increase the production of ecosystem services involve the simplification of natural systems. (Agriculture, for instance, typically has involved the replacement of relatively diverse systems with more simplified production systems.) And protecting some other ecosystem services may not necessarily require the conservation of biodiversity. (For example, a forested watershed could provide clean water whether it was covered in a diverse native forest or in a single-species plantation.) Ultimately, the level of biodiversity that survives on Earth will be determined not just by utilitarian considerations but to a significant extent by ethical concerns, including considerations of the intrinsic values of species."

Internationally agreed quotas in the early 1970s and, following the declaration by Canada of an Exclusive Fishing Zone in 1977, national quota systems ultimately failed to arrest and reverse the decline. The stock collapsed to extremely low levels in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and a moratorium on commercial fishing was declared in June 1992.

Land degradation and fires in poor countries, for example, have contributed to air quality degradation (dust and smoke) in wealthy ones.  Degradation of ecosystem services exacerbates poverty in developing countries, which can affect neighboring industrial countries by slowing regional economic growth and contributing to the outbreak of conflicts or the migration of refugees.  Changes in ecosystems that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate changes that affect all countries.  Many industries still depend directly on ecosystem services. The collapse of fisheries, for example, has harmed many communities in industrial countries. Prospects for the forest, agriculture, fishing, and ecotourism industries are all directly tied to ecosystem services, while other sectors such as insurance, banking, and health are strongly, if less directly, influenced by changes in ecosystem services.

(See Figure 3.6.) These changes increase the relative significance of the industrial and service sectors (using conventional economic measures that do not factor in nonmarketed costs and benefits) in comparison to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, although natural resourcebased sectors often still dominate in developing countries. In 2000, agriculture accounted for 5% of gross world product, industry 31%, and service industries 64%. At the same time, the importance of other nonmarketed ecosystem services has grown, although many of the benefits provided by these services are not captured in national economic statistics.

Among other regions, this includes sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and parts of South and Southeast Asia as well as some regions in Latin America. Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced increases in maternal deaths and income poverty (those living on less than $1 a day), and the number of people living in poverty there is forecast to rise from 315 million in 1999 to 404 million by 2015 (R19.1). Per capita food production has been declining in southern Africa, and relatively little gain is projected in the MA scenarios. Many of these regions include large areas of drylands, in which a combination of growing populations and land degradation are increasing the vulnerability of people to both economic and environmental change.

The MDGs aim to improve human well-being by reducing poverty, hunger, and child and maternal mortality; ensuring education for all; controlling and managing diseases; tackling gender disparity; ensuring sustainable development; and pursuing global partnerships. For each MDG, governments have agreed to between 1 and 8 targets (a total of 15 targets) that are to be achieved by 2015. Slowing or reversing the degradation of ecosystem services will contribute significantly to the achievement of many of the MDGs.  Poverty Eradication. Ecosystem services are a dominant influence on livelihoods of most poor people. Most of the worlds poorest people live in rural areas and are thus highly dependent, directly or indirectly, on the ecosystem service of food production, including agriculture, livestock, and hunting (R19.2.1). Mismanagement of ecosystems threatens the livelihood of poor people and may threaten their survival (C5.ES). Poor people are highly vulnerable to changes in watershed services that affect the quality or availability of water, loss of ecosystems such as wetlands, mangroves, or coral reefs that affect the likelihood of flood or storm damage, or changes in climate regulating services that might alter regional climate. Ecosystem degradation is often one of the factors trapping people in cycles of poverty.  Hunger Eradication (R19.2.2). Although economic and social factors are often the primary determinants of hunger, food production remains an important factor, particularly among the rural poor. Food production is an ecosystem service in its own right, and it also depends on watershed services, pollination, pest regulation, and soil formation. Food production needs to increase to meet the needs of the growing human population, and at the same time the efficiency of food production (the amount produced per unit of land, water, and other inputs) needs to increase in order to reduce harm to other key ecosystem services. Ecosystem condition, in particular climate, soil degradation, and water availability, influences progress toward this goal through its influence on crop yields as well as through impacts on the availability of wild sources of food.  Reducing Child Mortality. Undernutrition is the underlying cause of a substantial proportion of all child deaths. Child mortality is also strongly influenced by diseases associ- ated with water quality. Diarrhea is one of the predominant causes of infant deaths worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria additionally plays an important part in child mortality in many countries of the region.  Combating Disease (R19.2.7). Human health is strongly influenced by ecosystem services related to food production, water quality, water quantity, and natural hazard regulation, and the role of ecosystem management is central to addressing some of the most pressing global diseases such as malaria. Changes in ecosystems influence the abundance of human pathogens such as malaria and cholera as well as the risk of emergence of new diseases. Malaria is responsible for 11% of the disease burden in Africa, and it is estimated that Africas GDP could have been $100 billion larger (roughly a 25% increase) in 2000 if malaria had been eliminated 35 years ago (R16.1).  Environmental Sustainability. Achievement of this goal will require, at a minimum, an end to the current unsustainable uses of ecosystem services such as fisheries and fresh water and an end to the degradation of other services such as water purification, natural hazard regulation, disease regulation, climate regulation, and cultural amenities."

Most notably, per capita food production has declined in sub-Saharan Africa (C28.5.1).  Some 1.1 billion people still lack access to improved water supply and more than 2.6 billion have no access to improved sanitation. Water scarcity affects roughly 12 billion people worldwide. Since 1960, the ratio of water use to accessible supply has grown by 20% per decade (C7.ES, C7.2.3)."

This is not to say that ecosystem changes such as increased food production have not also helped to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But these changes have harmed many other communities, and their plight has been largely overlooked. Examples of these impacts include:  Half of the urban population in Africa, Asia, Latin Amer- ica, and the Caribbean suffers from one or more diseases associated with inadequate water and sanitation (C.SDM). Approximately 1.7 million people die annually as a result of inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (C7.ES).  The declining state of capture fisheries is reducing a cheap source of protein in developing countries. Per capita fish consumption in developing countries, excluding China, declined between 1985 and 1997 (C18.ES).  Desertification affects the livelihoods of millions of people, including a large portion of the poor in drylands (C22)."

Changes in ecosystems typically yield benefits for some people and exact costs on others, who may either lose access to resources or livelihoods or be affected by externalities associated with the change. For several reasons, groups such as the poor, women, and indigenous communities have tended to be harmed by these changes.  Many changes have been associated with the privatization of what were formerly common pool resources, and the individuals who are dependent on those resources have thus lost rights to them. This has been particularly the case for indigenous peoples, forest-dependent communities, and other groups relatively marginalized from political and economic sources of power.  Some of the people and places affected by changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services are highly vulnerable and poorly equipped to cope with the major ecosystem changes that may occur (C6.ES). Highly vulnerable groups include those whose needs for ecosystem services already exceed the supply, such as people lacking adequate clean water supplies and people living in areas with declining per capita agricultural production. Vulnerability has also been increased by the growth of populations in ecosystems at risk of disasters such as floods or drought, often due to inappropriate policies that have encouraged this growth. Populations are growing in low-lying coastal areas and dryland ecosystems. In part due to the growth in these vulnerable populations, the number of natural disasters (floods, droughts, earthquakes, and so on) requiring international assistance has quadrupled over the past four decades. Finally, vulnerability has been increased when the resilience in either the social or ecological system has been diminished, as for example through the loss of drought-resistant crop varieties.  Significant differences between the roles and rights of men and women in many societies lead to womens increased vulnerability to changes in ecosystem services. Rural women in developing countries are the main producers of staple crops like rice, wheat, and maize (R6 Box 6.1). Because the gendered division of labor within many societies places responsibility for routine care of the household with women, even when women also play important roles in agriculture, the degradation of ecosystem services such as water quality or quantity, fuelwood, agricultural or rangeland productivity often results in increased labor demands on women. This can affect the larger household by diverting time from food preparation, child care, education of children, and other beneficial activities (C6.3.3).Yet gender bias persists in agricultural policies in many countries, and rural women involved in agriculture tend to be the last to benefit fromor in some cases are negatively affected by development policies and new technologies.  The reliance of the rural poor on ecosystem services is rarely measured and thus typically overlooked in national statistics and in poverty assessments, resulting in inappropriate strategies that do not take into account the role of the environment in poverty reduction. For example, a recent study that synthesized data from 17 countries found that 22% of household income for rural communities in forested regions comes from sources typically not included in national statistics, such as harvesting wild food, fuelwood, fodder, medicinal plants, and timber. These activities generated a much higher proportion of poorer families total income than wealthy familiesincome that was of particular significance in periods of both predictable and unpredictable shortfalls in other livelihood sources (R17)."

Much of the catch is exported or shipped directly to Europe, while compensation for access is often low compared with the value of the product landed overseas. These countries do not necessarily benefit through increased fish supplies or higher government revenues when foreign distant water fleets ply their waters (C18.5.1)."

This in turn increases pressure on ecosystem services and can create a downward spiral of increasing poverty and further degradation of ecosystem services."

Drylands have the lowest per capita GDP and the highest infant mortality rates of all of the MA systems Nearly 500 million people live in rural areas in dry and semiarid lands, mostly in Asia and Africa but also in regions of Mexico and northern Brazil (C5 Box 5.2). The small amount of precipitation and its high variability limit the productive potential of drylands for settled farming and nomadic pastoralism, and many ways of expanding production (such as reducing fallow periods, overgrazing pasture areas, and cutting trees for fuelwood) result in environmental degradation. The combination of high variability in environmental conditions and relatively high levels of poverty leads to situations where human populations can be extremely sensitive to changes in the ecosystem (although the presence of these conditions has led to the development of very resilient land management strategies). Once rainfall in the Sahel reverted to normal low levels after 1970, following favorable rainfall from the 1950s to the mid-1960s that had attracted people to the region, an estimated 250,000 people died, along with nearly all their cattle, sheep, and goats (C5 Box 5.1)."

(See Figure 3.7.) One factor that has helped reduce relative population growth in marginal lands has been migration of some people out of marginal lands to cities or to agriculturally productive regions; today the opportunities for such migration are limited due to a combination of factors, including poor economic growth in some cities, tighter immigration restrictions in wealthy countries, and limited availability of land in more productive regions."

Collectively these factors influence the level of production and consumption of ecosystem services and the sustainability of production. Both economic growth and population growth lead to increased consumption of ecosystem services, although the harmful environmental impacts of any particular level of consumption depend on the efficiency of the technologies used in the production of the service. These factors interact in complex ways in different locations to change pressures on ecosystems and uses of ecosystem services. Driving forces are almost always multiple and interactive, so that a one-to-one linkage between particular driving forces and particular changes in ecosystems rarely exists. Even so, changes in any one of these indirect drivers generally result in changes in ecosystems. The causal linkage is almost always highly mediated by other factors, thereby complicating statements of causality or attempts to establish the proportionality of various contributors to changes. There are five major indirect drivers:  Demographic Drivers: Global population doubled in the past 40 years and increased by 2 billion people in the last 25 years, reaching 6 billion in 2000 (S7.2.1). Developing countries have accounted for most recent population growth in the past quartercentury, but there is now an unprecedented diversity of demographic patterns across regions and countries. Some high-income countries such as the United States are still experiencing high rates of population growth, while some developing countries such as China, Thailand, and North and South Korea have very low rates. In the United States, high population growth is due primarily to high levels of immigration. About half the people in the world now live in urban areas (although urban areas cover less than 3% of the terrestrial surface), up from less than 15% at the start of the twentieth century (C27.1). High-income countries typically have populations that are 7080% urban. Some developing-country regions, such as parts of Asia, are still largely rural, while Latin America, at 75% urban, is indistinguishable from high-income countries in this regard (S7.2.1).  Economic Drivers: Global economic activity increased nearly sevenfold between 1950 and 2000 (S7.SDM). With rising per capita income, the demand for many ecosystem services grows. At the same time, the structure of consumption changes. In the case of food, for example, as income grows the share of additional income spent on food declines, the importance of starchy staples (such as rice, wheat, and potatoes) declines, diets include more fat, meat and fish, and fruits and vegetables, and the proportionate consumption of industrial goods and services rises (S7.2.2)."

The level of per capita income was highest in North America, Western Europe, Australasia, and Northeast Asia, but both GDP growth rates and per capita GDP growth rates were highest in South Asia, China, and parts of South America (S7.2.2). (See Figures 4.1 and 4.2.) Growth in international trade flows has exceeded growth in global production for many years, and the differential may be growing. In 2001, international trade in goods was equal to 40% of gross world product. (S7.2.2)."

Fertilizer taxes or taxes on excess nutrients, for example, provide an incentive to increase the efficiency of the use of fertilizer applied to crops and thereby reduce negative externalities. Currently, many subsidies substantially increase rates of resource consumption and increase negative externalities. Annual subsidies to conventional energy, which encourage greater use of fossil fuels and consequently emissions of greenhouse gases, are estimated to have been $250300 billion in the mid-1990s (S7.ES). The 200103 average subsidies paid to the agricultural sectors of OECD countries were over $324 billion annually (S7.ES), encouraging greater food production and associated water consumption and nutrient and pesticide release. At the same time, many developing countries also have significant agricultural production subsidies.  Sociopolitical Drivers: Sociopolitical drivers encompass the forces influencing decision-making and include the quantity of public participation in decision-making, the groups participating in public decision-making, the mechanisms of dispute resolution, the role of the state relative to the private sector, and levels of education and knowledge (S7.2.3). These factors in turn influence the institutional arrangements for ecosystem management, as well as property rights over ecosystem services. Over the past"

There is a declining trend in centralized authoritarian governments and a rise in elected democracies. The role of women is changing in many countries, average levels of formal education are increasing, and there has been a rise in civil society (such as increased involvement of NGOs and grassroots organizations in decision-making processes). The trend toward democratic institutions has helped give power to local communities, especially women and resource-poor households (S7.2.3). There has been an increase in multilateral environmental agreements. The importance of the state relative to the private sectoras a supplier of goods and services, as a source of employment, and as a source of innovationis declining.  Cultural and Religious Drivers: To understand culture as a driver of ecosystem change, it is most useful to think of it as the values, beliefs, and norms that a group of people share. In this sense, culture conditions individuals perceptions of the world, influences what they consider important, and suggests what courses of action are appropriate and inappropriate (S7.2.4). Broad comparisons of whole cultures have not proved useful because they ignore vast variations in values, beliefs, and norms within cultures. Nevertheless, cultural differences clearly have important impacts on direct drivers. Cultural factors, for example, can influence consumption behavior (what and how much people consume) and values related to environmental stewardship, and they may be particularly important drivers of environmental change."

The impact of science and technology on ecosystem services is most evident in the case of food production. Much of the increase in agricultural output over the past 40 years has come from an increase in yields per hectare rather than an expansion of area under cultivation. For instance, wheat yields rose 208%, rice yields rose 109%, and maize yields rose 157% in the past 40 years in developing countries (S7.2.5).

Increased trade can accelerate degradation of ecosystem services in exporting countries if their policy, regulatory, and management systems are inadequate. At the same time, international trade enables comparative advantages to be exploited and accelerates the diffusion of more-efficient technologies and practices. For example, the increased demand for forest products in many countries stimulated by growth in forest products trade can lead to more rapid degradation of forests in countries with poor systems of regulation and management, but can also stimulate a virtuous cycle if the regulatory framework is sufficiently robust to prevent resource degradation while trade, and profits, increase. While historically most trade related to ecosystems has involved provisioning services such as food, timber, fiber, genetic resources, and biochemicals, one regulating serviceclimate regulation, or more specifically carbon sequestrationis now also traded internationally."

In 9 of the 14 terrestrial biomes examined in the MA, between one half and one fifth of the area has been transformed, largely to croplands (C4.ES). Only biomes relatively unsuited to crop plants, such as deserts, boreal forests, and tundra, have remained largely untransformed by human action. Both land cover changes and the management practices and technologies used on lands may cause major changes in ecosystem services. New technologies have resulted in significant increases in the supply of some ecosystem services, such as through increases in agricultural yield. In the case of cereals, for example, from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s the global area under cereals fell by around 0.3% a year, while yields increased by about 1.2% a year (C26.4.1)."

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the biological capability of commercially exploited fish stocks was probably at a historical low. FAO estimates that about half of the commercially exploited wild marine fish stocks for which information is available are fully exploited and offer no scope for increased catches, and a further quarter are over exploited. (C8.2.2). As noted in Key Question 1, fishing pressure is so strong in some marine systems that the biomass of some targeted species, especially larger fishes, and those caught incidentally has been reduced to one tenth of levels prior to the onset of industrial fishing (C18.ES). Fishing has had a particularly significant impact in coastal areas but is now also affecting the open oceans."

It is speculated that 50% of inland water ecosystems (excluding large lakes and closed seas) were converted during the twentieth century (C20.ES). Massive changes have been made in water regimes: in Asia, 78% of the total reservoir volume was constructed in the last decade, and in South America almost 60% of all reservoirs have been built since the 1980s (C20.4.2). The introduction of non-native invasive species is one of the major causes of species extinction in freshwater systems. While the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen is necessary for biological systems, high levels of nutrient loading cause significant eutrophication of water bodies and contribute to high levels of nitrate in drinking water in some locations. (The nutrient load refers to the total amount of nitrogen or phosphorus entering the water during a given time.) Non-point pollution sources such as storm water runoff in urban areas, poor or nonexistent sanitation facilities in rural areas, and the flushing of livestock manure by rainfall and snowmelt are also causes of contamination (C20.4.5). Pollution from point sources such as mining has had devastating local and regional impacts on the biota of inland waters."

Although human activities have increased sediment flows in rivers by about 20%, reservoirs and water diversions prevent about 30% of sediments from reaching the oceans, resulting in a net reduction of 10% in the sediment delivery to estuaries, which are key nursery areas and fishing grounds (C19.ES). Approximately 17% of the world lives within the boundaries of the MA coastal system (up to an elevation of 50 meters above sea level and no further than 100 kilometers from a coast), and approximately 40% live in the full area within 50 kilometers of a coast.

Economic growth is the highest of the four scenarios, while this scenario is assumed to have the lowest population in 2050.  Order from Strength: This scenario represents a regionalized and fragmented world that is concerned with security and protection, emphasizes primarily regional markets, pays little attention to public goods, and takes a reactive approach to ecosystem problems.

Adapting Mosaic: In this scenario, regional watershed-scale ecosystems are the focus of political and economic activity. Local institutions are strengthened and local ecosystem management strategies are common; societies develop a strongly proactive approach to the management of ecosystems. Economic growth rates are somewhat low initially but increase with time, and the population in 2050 is nearly as high as in Order from Strength.

In such cases new problems often seem to emerge from the last solution, and the costs of managing the environment are continually rising. Environmental breakdowns that affect large numbers of people become more common. Sometimes new problems seem to emerge faster than solutions. The challenge for the future is to learn how to organize socioecological systems so that ecosystem services are maintained without taxing societys ability to implement solutions to novel, emergent problems."

Some factors (such as global population growth) will begin to decline in importance and others (distribution of people, climate change, and changes to nutrient cycles) will gain more importance.

They do not indicate the likelihood that any particular scenario and its associated projection will come to pass. With that caveat in mind, the four MA scenarios describe these changes between 2000 and 2050 (or in some cases 2100):  Population is projected to grow to 8.19.6 billion in 2050 (medium to high certainty) and to 6.810.5 billion in 2100, depending on the scenario (S7.2.1). (See Figure 5.1.) The rate of global population growth has already peaked, at 2.1% per year in the late 1960s, and had fallen to 1.35% per year in 2000, when global population reached 6 billion (S7.ES). Population growth over the next several decades is expected to be concentrated in the poorest, urban communities in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East (S7.ES).  Per capita income is projected to increase twoto fourfold, depending on the scenario (low to medium certainty) (S7.2.2). Gross world product is projected to increase roughly three to sixfold in the different scenarios. Increasing income leads to increasing per capita consumption in most parts of the world for most resources and it changes the structure of consumption. For example, diets tend to become higher in animal protein as income rises.  Land use change (primarily the continuing expansion of agriculture) is projected to continue to be a major direct driver of change in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems (medium to high certainty) (S9.ES). At the global level and across all scenarios, land use change is projected to remain the dominant driver of biodiversity change in terrestrial ecosystems, consistent with the pattern over the past 50 years, followed by changes in climate and nitrogen deposition (S10.ES). However, other direct drivers may be more important than land use change in particular biomes. For example, climate change is likely to be the dominant driver of biodiversity change in tundra and deserts. Species invasions and water extraction are important drivers for freshwater ecosystems.  Nutrient loading is projected to become an increasingly severe problem, particularly in developing countries. Nutrient loading already has major adverse effects on freshwater ecosystems and coastal regions in both industrial and developing countries. These impacts include toxic algae blooms, other human health problems, fish kills, and damage to habitats such as coral reefs. Three out of the four MA scenarios project that the global flux of nitrogen to coastal ecosystems will increase by 1020% by 2030 (medium certainty) (S9.3.7.2). (See Figure 5.2.) River nitrogen will not change in most industrial countries, while a 20 30% increase is projected for developing countries, particularly in Asia.  Climate change and its impacts (such as sea level rise) are projected to have an increasing effect on biodiversity and ecosystem services (medium certainty) (S9.ES). Under the four MA scenarios, global temperature is expected to increase significantly1.5 2.0o Celsius above preindustrial level in 2050 and 2.03.5o Celsius above it in 2100, depending on the scenario and using (continued on page 78)"

This is due to a combination of factors related to food supply systems (inadequate investments in food production and its supporting infrastructure resulting in low productivity increases, varying trade regimes) and food demand and accessibility (continuing poverty in combination with high population growth rates, lack of food infrastructure investments).  Vast, complex changes with great geographic variability are projected to occur in world freshwater resources and hence in their provisioning of ecosystem services in all scenarios (S.SDM).

Inherent in this concept of space and time is the adaptive capacity of the Quechua people, who welcome change and have become resilient to it through an adaptive learning process. (It is recognized that current rates of change may prove challenging to the adaptive capacities of the communities.) The cross shape of the Vilcanota framework diagram represents the Chakana, the most recognized and sacred shape to Quechua people, and orders the world through deliberative and collective decision-making that emphasizes reciprocity (Ayni). Pachamama is similar to a combination of the ecosystem goods and services and human well-being components of the MA framework. Pachakuti is similar to the MA drivers (both direct and indirect).

Habitat loss can lead to rapid extinction of some species (such as those with extremely limited ranges); but for many species, extinction will only occur after many generations, and longlived species such as some trees could persist for centuries before ultimately going extinct.

Species introductions and losses: Introductions (or removal) of species can cause nonlinear changes in ecosystems and their services. For example, the introduction of the zebra mussel (see photo above) into U.S. aquatic systems resulted in the extirpation of native clams in Lake St. Clair, large changes in energy flow and ecosystem function, and annual costs of $100 million to the power industry and other users (S12.4.8). The introduction of the comb jelly fish (Mnemiopsis leidyi) in the Black Sea caused the loss of 26 major fisheries species and has been implicated (along with other factors) in subsequent growth of the anoxic dead zone (C28.5). The loss of the sea otters from many coastal ecosystems on the Pacific Coast of North America due to hunting led to the booming populations of sea urchins (a prey species for otters) which in turn led to the loss of kelp forests (which are eaten by urchins).  Changes in dominant species in coral ecosystems: Some coral reef ecosystems have undergone sudden shifts from coral-dominated to algae-dominated reefs. The trigger for such phase shifts, which are essentially irreversible, is usually multifaceted and includes increased nutrient input leading to eutrophic conditions, and removal of herbivorous fishes that maintain the balance between corals and algae. Once a threshold is reached, the change in the ecosystem takes place within months and the resulting ecosystem, although stable, is less productive and less diverse. One well-studied example is the sudden switch in 1983 from coral to algal domination of Jamaican reef systems. This followed several centuries of overfishing of herbivores, which left the control of algal cover almost entirely dependent on a single species of sea urchin, whose populations collapsed when exposed to a species-specific pathogen. As a result, Jamaicas reefs shifted (apparently irreversibly) to a new low-diversity, algae-dominated state with very limited capacity to support fisheries (C4.6).  Regional climate change (C13.3): The vegetation in a region influences climate through albedo (reflectance of radiation from the surface), transpiration (flux of water from the ground to the atmosphere through plants), and the aerodynamic properties of"

In the Sahel region of North Africa, vegetation cover is almost completely controlled by rainfall. When vegetation is present, rainfall is quickly recycled, generally increasing precipitation and, in turn, leading to a denser vegetation canopy. Model results suggest that land degradation leads to a substantial reduction in water recycling and may have contributed to the observed trend in rainfall reduction in the region over the last 30 years. In tropical regions, deforestation generally leads to decreased rainfall. Since forest existence crucially depends on rainfall, the relationship between tropical forests and precipitation forms a positive feedback that, under certain conditions, theoretically leads to the existence of two steady states: rainforest and savanna (although some models suggest only one stable climate-vegetation state in the Amazon)."

The increased likelihood of these events stems from the following factors:  On balance, changes humans are making to ecosystems are reducing the resilience of the ecological components of the systems (established but incomplete) (C6, S3, S12). Genetic and species diversity, as well as spatial patterns of landscapes, environmental fluctuations, and temporal cycles with which species evolved, generate the resilience of ecosystems. Functional groups of species contribute to ecosystem processes and services in similar ways. Diversity among functional groups increases the flux of ecosystem processes and services (established but incomplete). Within functional groups, species respond differently to environmental fluctuations. This response diversity derives from variation in the response of species to environmental drivers, heterogeneity in species distributions, differences in ways that species use seasonal cycles or disturbance patterns, or other mechanisms. Response diversity enables ecosystems to adjust in changing environments, altering biotic structure in ways that maintain processes and services (high certainty) (S.SDM). The loss of biodiversity that is now taking place thus tends to reduce the resilience of ecosystems.  There are growing pressures from various drivers (S7, SG7.5). Threshold changes in ecosystems are not uncommon, but they are infrequently encountered in the absence of human-caused pressures on ecosystems. Many of these pressures are now growing. Increased fish harvests raise the likelihood of fisheries collapses; higher rates of climate change boost the potential for species extinctions; increased introductions of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment make the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems more likely; as human populations become more mobile, more and more species are being introduced into new habitats, and this increases the chance of harmful pests emerging in those regions."

Growth in the use and trade of bushmeat is placing increasing pressure on many species, particularly in Africa and Asia. While population size of harvested species may decline gradually with increasing harvest for some time, once the harvest exceeds sustainable levels, the rate of decline of populations of the harvested species will tend to accelerate. This could place them at risk of extinction and also reduce the food supply of the people dependent on these resources. Finally, the bushmeat trade involves relatively high levels of interaction between humans and some relatively closely related wild animals that are eaten. Again, this increases the risk of a nonlinear change, in this case the emergence of new and serious pathogens. Given the speed and magnitude of international travel today, new pathogens could spread rapidly around the world."

For example, the recovery of overexploited fisheries that have been closed to fishing is quite variable. Although the cod fishery in Newfoundland has been closed for 13 years (except for a small inshore fishery between 1998 and 2003), there have been few signs of a recovery, and many scientists are not optimistic about its return in the foreseeable future (C18.2.6).

Three of the four MA scenarios show that changes in policies, institutions, and practices can mitigate some of the negative consequences of growing pressures on ecosystems, although the changes required are large and not currently under way (S.SDM).

The scale of interventions that results in these positive outcomes, however, is very significant. The interventions include major investments in environmentally sound technology, active adaptive management, proactive actions to address environmental problems before their full consequences are experienced, major investments in public goods (such as education and health), strong action to reduce socioeconomic disparities and eliminate poverty, and expanded capacity of people to manage ecosystems adaptively."

The most important public policy decisions affecting ecosystems are often made by agencies and in policy arenas other than those charged with protecting ecosystems. Ecosystem management goals are more likely to be achieved if they are reflected in decisions in other sectors and in national development strategies. For example, the Poverty Reduction Strategies prepared by developing-country governments for the World Bank and other institutions strongly shape national development priorities, but in general these have not taken into account the importance of ecosystems to improving the basic human capabilities of the poorest (R17.ES).  Increased coordination among multilateral environmental agreements and between environmental agreements and other international economic and social institutions (G). International agreements are indispensable for addressing ecosystem-related concerns that span national boundaries, but numerous obstacles weaken their current effectiveness (R17.2). The limited, focused nature of the goals and mechanisms included in most bilateral and multilateral environmental treaties does not address the broader issue of ecosystem services and human well-being. Steps are now being taken to increase coordination among these treaties, and this could help broaden the focus of the array of instruments. However, coordination is also needed between the multilateral environmental agreements and the more politically powerful international legal institutions, such as economic and trade agreements, to ensure that they are not acting at cross-purposes (R.SDM). And implementation of these agreements also needs to be coordinated among relevant institutions and sectors at the national level.

For example, degradation of freshwater and other ecosystem services generally have a disproportionate impact on those who are, in various ways, excluded from participation in the decision-making process (R7.2.3). Stakeholder participation also contributes to the decision-making process because it allows a better understanding of impacts and vulnerability, the distribution of costs and benefits associated with trade-offs, and the identification of a broader range of response options that are available in a specific context. And stakeholder involvement and transparency of decisionmaking can increase accountability and reduce corruption.  Development of institutions that devolve (or centralize) decision-making to meet management needs while ensuring effective coordination across scales (G, B, N) (RWG). Problems of ecosystem management have been exacerbated by both overly centralized and overly decentralized decision-making. For example, highly centralized forest management has proved ineffective in many countries, and efforts are now being made to move responsibility to lower levels of decisionmaking either within the natural resources sector or as part of broader decentralization of governmental responsibilities. At the same time, one of the most intractable problems of ecosystem management has been the lack of alignment between political boundaries and units appropriate for the management of ecosystem goods and services. Downstream communities may not have access to the institutions through which upstream actions can be influenced; alternatively, downstream communities or countries may be stronger politically than upstream regions and may dominate control of upstream areas without addressing upstream needs. A number of countries, however, are now strengthening regional institutions for the management of transboundary ecosystems (such as the Danube River, the Mekong River Commission, East African cooperation on Lake Victoria, and the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization).  Development of institutions to regulate interactions between markets and ecosystems (G) (RWG). The potential of policy and market reforms to improve ecosystem management are often constrained by weak or absent institutions. For example, the potential of the Clean Development Mechanism established under the Framework Convention on Climate Change to provide financial support to developing countries in return for greenhouse gas reductions, which would realize climate and biodiversity benefits through payments for carbon sequestration in forests, is constrained by unclear property rights, concerns over the permanence of reductions, and lack of mechanisms for resolving conflicts. Moreover, existing regulatory institutions often do not have ecosystem protection as a clear mandate. For example, independent regulators of privatized water systems and power systems do not necessarily promote resource use efficiency and renewable supply. There is a continuing importance of the role of the state to set and enforce rules even in the context of privatization and market-led growth.  Development of institutional frameworks that promote a shift from highly sectoral resource management approaches to more integrated approaches (G, B) (R15.ES, R12.ES, R11.ES). In most countries, separate ministries are in charge of different aspects of ecosystems (such as ministries of environment, agriculture, water, and forests) and different drivers of change (such as ministries of energy, transportation, development, and trade). Each of these ministries has control over different aspects of ecosystem management. As a result, there is seldom the political will to develop effective ecosystem management strategies, and competition among the ministries can often result in policy choices that are detrimental to ecosystems.

Because many ecosystem services are not traded in markets, markets fail to provide appropriate signals that might otherwise contribute to the efficient allocation and sustainable use of the services. Even if people are aware of the services provided by an ecosystem, they are neither compensated for providing these services nor penalized for reducing them. In addition, the people harmed by the degradation of ecosystem services are often not the ones who benefit from the actions leading to their degradation, and so those costs are not factored into management decisions. A wide range of opportunities exists to influence human behavior to address this challenge in the form of economic and financial instruments. Some of them establish markets; others work through the monetary and financial interests of the targeted social actors; still others affect relative prices."

The adoption of economic instruments usually requires a legal framework, and in many cases the choice of a viable and effective economic intervention mechanism is determined by the socioeconomic context. For example, resource taxes can be a powerful instrument to guard against the overexploitation of an ecosystem service, but an effective tax scheme requires well-established and reliable monitoring and tax collection systems. Similarly, subsidies can be effective to introduce and implement certain technologies or management procedures, but they are inappropriate in settings that lack the transparency and accountability needed to prevent corruption. The establishment of market mechanisms also often involves explicit decisions about wealth distribution and resource allocation, when, for example, decisions are made to establish private property rights for resources that were formerly considered common pool resources.

On the social side, agricultural subsidies make farmers overly dependent on taxpayers for their livelihood, change wealth distribution and social composition by benefiting large corporate farms to the detriment of smaller family farms, and contribute to the dependence of large segments of the developing world on aid.

The farmers and fishers benefiting directly from the subsidies would suffer the most immediate losses, but there would also be indirect effects on ecosystems both locally and globally. In some cases it may be possible to transfer production subsides to other activities that promote ecosystem stewardship, such as payment for the provision or enhancement of regulatory or supporting services. Compensatory mechanisms may be needed for the poor who are adversely affected by the immediate removal of subsidies (R17.5). Reduced subsidies within the OECD may lessen pressures on some ecosystems in those countries, but they could lead to more rapid conversion and intensification of land for agriculture in developing countries and would thus need to be accompanied by policies to minimize the adverse impacts on ecosystems there.  Greater use of economic instruments and market-based approaches in the management of ecosystem services (G, B, N) (RWG). Economic instruments and market mechanisms with the potential to enhance the management of ecosystem services include:  Taxes or user fees for activities with external costs (trade-offs not accounted for in the market). These instruments create an incentive that lessens the external costs and provides revenues that can help protect the damaged ecosystem services. Examples include taxes on excessive application of nutrients or ecotourism user fees.  Creation of markets, including through cap-and-trade systems. Ecosystem services that have been treated as free resources, as is often the case for water, tend to be used wastefully. The establishment of markets for the services can both increase the incentives for their conservation and increase the economic efficiency of their allocation if supporting legal and economic institutions are in place. However, as noted earlier, while markets will increase the efficiency of the use of the resource, they can have harmful effects on particular groups of users who may inequitably affected by the change (R17). The combination of regulated emission caps, coupled with market mechanisms for trading pollution rights, often provides an efficient means of reducing emissions harmful to ecosystems. For example, nutrient trading systems may be a low-cost way to reduce water pollution in the United States (R7 Box 7.3)."

The value of carbon dioxide trades in 2003 was approximately $300 million. About one quarter of the trades (by volume of CO2 equivalents) involve investment in ecosystem services (hydropower or biomass). The World Bank has established a fund with a capital of $33.3 million (as of January 2005) to invest in afforestation and reforestation projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forest and agroecosystems while promoting biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. It is speculated that the value of the global carbon emissions trading markets may reach $10 billion to $44 billion in 2010 (and involve trades totaling 4.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent).  Payment for ecosystem services. Mechanisms can be established to enable individuals, firms, or the public sector to pay resource owners to provide particular services. For example, in New South Wales, Australia, associations of farmers purchase salinity credits from the State Forests Agency, which in turn contracts with upstream landholders to plant trees, which reduce water tables and store carbon. Similarly, in 1996 Costa Rica established a nationwide system of conservation payments to induce landowners to provide ecosystem services. Under this program, the government brokers contracts between international and domestic buyers and local sellers of sequestered carbon, biodiversity, watershed services, and scenic beauty.

Behavioral changes that could reduce demand for degraded ecosystem services can be encouraged through actions by governments (such as education and public awareness programs or the promotion of demand-side management), industry (such as improved product labeling or commitments to use raw materials from sources certified as sustainable), and civil society (such as public awareness campaigns).

Technologies already exist for reducing nutrient pollution at reasonable costsincluding technologies to reduce point source emissions, changes in crop management practices, and precision farming techniques to help control the application of fertilizers to a field, for examplebut new policies are needed for these tools to be applied on a sufficient scale to slow and ultimately reverse the increase in nutrient loading (recognizing that this global goal must be achieved even while increasing nutrient applications in some regions such as sub-Saharan Africa).

Most resource management and investment decisions are strongly influenced by considerations of the monetary costs and benefits of alternative policy choices. In the case of ecosystem management, however, this often leads to outcomes that are not in the interest of society, since the nonmarketed values of ecosystems may exceed the marketed values. As a result, many existing resource management policies favor sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and fisheries at the expense of the use of these same ecosystems for water supply, recreation, and cultural services that may be of greater economic value. Decisions can be improved if they include the total economic value of alternative management options and involve deliberative mechanisms that bring to bear noneconomic considerations as well.  Use of all relevant forms of knowledge and information in assessments and decision-making, including traditional and practitioners knowledge (G, B, N) (RWG, C17.ES). Effective management of ecosystems typically requires place-based knowledgeinformation about the specific characteristics and history of an ecosystem. Formal scientific information is often one source of such information, but traditional knowledge or practitioners knowledge held by local resource managers can be of equal or greater value. While that knowledge is used in the decisions taken by those who have it, it is too rarely incorporated into other decision-making processes and is often inappropriately dismissed.  Enhance and sustain human and institutional capacity for assessing the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and acting on such assessments (G, B, N) (RWG). Greater technical capacity is needed for agriculture, forest, and fisheries management. But the capacity that exists for these sectors, as limited as it is in many countries, is still vastly greater than the capacity for effective management of other ecosystem services. Because awareness of the importance of these other services has only recently grown, there is limited experience with assessing ecosystem services fully. Serious limits exist in all countries, but especially in developing countries, in terms of the expertise needed in such areas as monitoring changes in ecosystem services, economic valuation or health assessment of ecosystem changes, and policy analysis related to ecosystem services. Even when such assessment information is available, however, the traditional highly sectoral nature of decision-making and resource management makes the implementation of recommendations difficult. This constraint can also be overcome through increased training of individuals in existing institutions and through institutional reforms to build capacity for more integrated responses."

For example, a local project to improve livelihoods of communities surrounding a protected area in order to reduce pressure on it, if successful, may increase migration into buffer zones, thereby adding to pressures. Cross-scale responses may be more effective at addressing the higher-level constraints and leakage problems and simultaneously tackling regional and national as well as local-level drivers of change.

Marine fish landings are now declining as a result of the overexploitation of this resource (C18.ES). Inland water fisheries, which are particularly important in providing high-quality diets for poor people, have also declined due to habitat modification, overfishing, and water withdrawals (C8.ES).

Water withdrawals began to decline in many parts of the OECD at the end of the twentieth century, and with medium certainty will continue to decline throughout the OECD during the twenty-first century because of saturation of per capita demands, efficiency improvements, and stabilizing populations (S9.ES).  Water withdrawals are expected to increase greatly outside the OECD as a result of economic development and population growth. The extent of these increases is very scenario-dependent. In sub-Saharan Africa, domestic water use greatly increases and this implies (low to medium certainty) an increased access to fresh water. However, the technical and economic feasibility of increasing domestic water withdrawals is very uncertain (S9.ES).

Rates of growth in harvests have slowed in recent years.  Fuelwood is the primary source of energy for heating and cooking for some 2.6 billion people, and 55% of global wood consumption is for fuelwood (C9.ES). Although they account for less than 7% of world energy use, fuelwood and charcoal provide 40% of energy use in Africa and 10% in Latin America (C9.4).  Global consumption of fuelwood appears to have peaked in the 1990s and is now believed to be slowly declining as a result of switching to alternate fuels and, to a lesser degree, more-efficient biomass energy technologies. In contrast, global consumption of charcoal appears to have doubled between 1975 and 2000, largely as a result of continuing population shifts toward urban areas (C9.4.1).  Localized fuelwood shortages in Africa impose burdens on people who depend on fuelwood for home heating and cooking (SG3.4). The impact on people may be high prices in urban areas or lengthy and arduous travel to collect wood in rural areas.  Among agricultural fibers, global cotton production has doubled and silk production has tripled since 1961 (C9.ES). Despite this doubling of production, the land area on which cotton is harvested has stayed virtually the same. Production of flax, wool, hemp, jute, and sisal has declined. For example, competition from synthetic fabrics has contributed to a reduction in the demand for wool in recent decades; wool production declined 16% between 1980 and 2000 (C9.5.3)."

Forest loss in TechnoGarden decreases in the first decades of the scenario period, but over the whole period is near the historic rate because the use of biofuels increases as part of climate change policies, leading to further pressure on forest area.

(See Appendix Figure A.6.) Ecosystem changes account for about 1030% of the radiative forcing of CO2 since 1750 and a large proportion of the radiative forcing due to CH4 and N2O. Ecosystems are currently a net sink for CO2 and tropospheric ozone, while they remain a net source of CH4 and N2O. Future management of ecosystems has the potential to modify concentrations of a number of greenhouse gases, although this potential is likely to be small in comparison to IPCC scenarios of fossil fuel emissions over the next century (high certainty). Ecosystems influence the main anthropogenic greenhouse gases as follows:  Carbon dioxide: About 40% of the historical emissions (over the last two centuries), and about 20% of current CO2 emissions (in the 1990s), originated from changes in land use and land management, primarily deforestation. Terrestrial ecosystems were a sink for about a third of cumulative historical emissions and a third of total emissions in the 1990s (energy plus land use). The sink may be explained partially by afforestation, reforestation, and forest management in North America, Europe, China, and other regions and partially by the fertilizing effects of N deposition and increasing atmospheric CO2. Terrestrial ecosystems were on average a net source of CO2 during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and became a net sink sometime around the middle of the last century (high certainty). The net impact of ocean biology changes on global CO2 fluxes is unknown.  Methane: Natural processes in wetland ecosystems account for about 2530% of current methane emissions, and about 30% of emissions are due to agriculture (ruminant animals and rice paddies).  Nitrous oxide: Ecosystem sources account for about 90% of current N2O emissions, with 35% of emissions from agricultural systems, primarily driven by fertilizer use.  Tropospheric ozone: Dry deposition in ecosystems accounts for about half the tropospheric ozone sink. Several gases emitted by ecosystems, primarily due to biomass burning, act as precursors for tropospheric ozone formation (NOX, volatile organic compounds, CO, CH4). The net global effect of ecosystems is as a sink for tropospheric O3."

However, with the steady increase in crop yields, which increases crop biomass and the amount of residue returned to the soil, and with the adoption of conservation tillage and no-till cropping systems, net carbon sequestration is estimated to occur in the maize-soybean systems of North America and in some continuous irrigated lowland rice systems. Agriculture accounts for 44% of anthropogenic methane emissions and about 70% of anthropogenic nitrous oxide gases, mainly from the conversion of new land to agriculture and nitrogen fertilizer use (C26.2.6).  Terrestrial and marine plants fix atmospheric CO2 and return it via respiration. In the ocean, some of the carbon sinks in the form of dead organisms, particles, and dissolved organic carbon, a small amount of which remains in sediments; the rest is respired at depth and eventually recirculated to the surface (the biological pump). The biological pump acts as a net sink for CO2 by increasing its concentration at depth, where it is isolated from the atmosphere for decades to centuries, causing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to be about 200 parts per million lower than it would be in the absence of life (C13.2.1). On the land large amounts of carbon fixed by plants are stored in soil organic matter.  Land cover changes since 1750 have increased the reflectivity to solar radiation (albedo) of the land surface (medium certainty), partially offsetting the warming effect of associated CO2 emissions (C13.ES). Deforestation and desertification in the tropics and sub-tropics leads to a reduction in regional rainfall (high certainty). Biophysical effects need to be accounted for in the assessment of options for climate change mitigation. For example, the warming effect of reforestation in seasonally snow-covered regions due to albedo decrease is likely to exceed the cooling effect of additional carbon storage in biomass. Biophysical effects of ecosystem changes on regional climate patterns depend on geographical location and season. With high certainty:  Deforestation in seasonally snow-covered regions leads to regional cooling of the land surface during the snow season due to increase in surface albedo, and it leads to warming during the summer due to reduction in evapotranspiration.  Large-scale tropical deforestation (hundreds of square kilometers) reduces regional rainfall, primarily due to decreased evapotranspiration.  Desertification in the tropics and sub-tropics leads to decrease in regional precipitation due to reduced evapotranspiration and increased surface albedo."

Currently, the biosphere is a net sink of carbon, absorbing about 12 gigatons of carbon per year, or approximately 20% of fossil fuel emissions. It is very likely that the future of this service will be greatly affected by expected land use change. In addition, a higher atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to enhance net productivity, but this does not necessarily lead to an increase in the carbon sink. The limited understanding of soil respiration processes generates uncertainty about the future of the carbon sink. There is medium certainty that climate change will increase terrestrial fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in some regions (such as in Arctic tundras) (S9.ES)."

Ecosystem modifications associated with developments such as dam building and the expansion of agricultural irrigation, for example, have sometimes increased the local incidence of infectious diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, and arbovirus infections, especially in the tropics. Other modifications to ecosystems have served to reduce the incidence of infectious disease."

Major tropical diseases, particularly malaria, meningitis, leishmaniasis, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, African trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, filariasis, and diarrheal diseases still infect millions of people throughout the world (very certain) (C14.ES).  The prevalence of the following infectious diseases is particularly strongly influenced by ecological change: malaria across most ecological systems; schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and Japanese encephalitis in cultivated and inland water systems in the tropics; dengue fever in tropical urban centers; leishmaniasis and Chagas disease in forest and dryland systems; meningitis in the Sahel; cholera in coastal, freshwater, and urban systems; and West Nile virus and Lyme disease in urban and suburban systems of Europe and North America (high certainty) (C14.ES).  Various changes to ecosystems can affect disease incidence through a variety of mechanisms. Disease/ecosystem relationships that best exemplify these biological mechanisms include the following examples (C14.ES):  Dams and irrigation canals provide ideal habitat for snails that serve as the intermediate reservoir host species for schistosomiasis; irrigated rice fields increase in the extent of mosquito-breeding surface, increasing the chance of transmission of mosquito-borne malaria, lymphatic filariasis, Japanese encephalitis, and Rift Valley fever.  Deforestation has increased the risk of malaria in Africa and South America by increasing habitat suitable for malariatransmitting mosquitoes.  Natural systems with preserved structure and characteristics generally resist the introduction of invasive human and animal pathogens brought by human migration and settlement. This seems to be the case for cholera, kala-azar, and schistosomiasis, which did not become established in the Amazonian forest ecosystem (medium certainty).  Uncontrolled urbanization in the forest ecosystem has been associated with mosquito-borne viruses (arboviruses) in the Amazon and with lymphatic filariasis in Africa. Tropical urban areas with poor water supply systems and lack of shelter promote transmission of dengue fever.  There is evidence that habitat fragmentation, with subsequent biodiversity loss, increases the prevalence in ticks of the bacteria that causes Lyme disease in North America (medium certainty).  Zoonotic pathogens (defined by their natural life cycle in animals) are a significant cause of both historical (such as HIV and tuberculosis) and newly emerging infectious diseases affecting humans (such as SARS, West Nile virus, and Hendra virus). In addition, zoonotic pathogens can cause high case-fatality rates and are difficult to vaccinate against, since the primary reservoir hosts are nonhumans.  Intensive livestock agriculture that uses subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli bacteria. Overcrowded and mixed livestock practices, as well as the trade in bushmeat, can facilitate interspecies host transfer of disease agents, leading to dangerous novel pathogens such as SARS and new strains of influenza."

Some wastessewage, for instanceare produced in nearly direct proportion to population size. Other types of wastes and contaminants reflect the affluence of society. An affluent society uses and generates a larger volume of waste-producing materials such as domestic trash and home-use chemicals (C15.ES).  Where there is significant economic development, loadings of certain wastes are expected to increase faster than population growth. The generation of some wastes (industrial waste, for example) does not necessarily increase with population or development state. These wastes may often be reduced through regulation aimed to encourage producers to clean discharges or to seek alternate manufacturing processes (C15.ES).  In developing countries, 9095% of all sewage and 70% of industrial wastes are dumped untreated into surface water (C7.4.5). Regional patterns of processing nitrogen loads in freshwater ecosystems provide a clear example of the overloading of the waste processing service of ecosystems.  Aquatic ecosystems cleanse on average 80% of their global incident nitrogen loading but this intrinsic self-purification capacity of these ecosystems varies widely and is not unlimited (C7.2.5).  Severe deterioration in the quality of fresh water is magnified in cultivated and urban systems (high use, high pollution sources) and in dryland systems (high demand for flow regulation, absence of dilution potential) (C7.ES)."

The detoxification capabilities of individual locations may change with changing conditions (such as changes in soil moisture levels). At high waste-loading rates, however, the intrinsic capability of environments is overwhelmed, such that wastes will build up in the environment to the detriment of human well-being and a loss of biodiversity (C15.ES).  The service of water purification could be either enhanced or degraded in both developing and industrial countries under the MA Scenarios (S9.5.4). Within industrial countries, the dilution capacity of most rivers increases because higher precipitation leads to increases in runoff in most river basins. Wetland areas decrease because of the expansion of population and agricultural land. Wastewater flows increase, but in some scenarios the wealth of the North enables it to repair breakdowns in water purification as they occur. Within developing countries, the pace of ecosystem degradation, the overtaxing of ecosystems by high waste loads, and the decline of wetland area because of the expansion of population and agricultural land tend to drive a deterioration of water purification in two scenarios. The Adapting Mosaic scenario, however, could lead to some gains in water purification even in developing countries, and the TechnoGarden scenario would also result in gains."

These actions are exacerbating human vulnerability to extreme events, such as the December 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Many measures of human vulnerability show a general increase due to growing poverty, mainly in developing countries (C16.ES).  Roughly 17% of all the urban land in the United States is located in the 100-year flood zone. Likewise, in Japan about 50% of the population lives on floodplains, which cover only 10% of the land area. In Bangladesh, the percentage of floodprone areas is much higher and inundation of more than half of the country is not uncommon. For example, about two thirds of the country was inundated in the 1998 flood (C16.2.2).  Many of the available datasets on extreme events show that impacts are increasing in many regions around the world. From 1992 to 2001, floods were the most frequent natural disaster (43% of 2,257 disasters), and they killed 96,507 people and affected more than 1.2 billion people over the decade. Annual economic losses from extreme events increased tenfold from the 1950s to the 1990s (C16.ES).  The loss of ecosystems such as wetlands and mangroves has significantly reduced natural mechanisms of protection from natural hazards. For example, forested riparian wetlands adjacent to the Mississippi River in the United States during presettlement times had the capacity to store about 60 days of river discharge. With the removal of wetlands through canalization, leveeing, and draining, the remaining wetlands have a storage capacity of less than 12 days dischargean 80% reduction of flood storage capacity (C16.1.1).  The number of floods and fires increased significantly on all continents over the past 60 years. (See Appendix Figures A.7 and A.8.)  Within industrial countries, the area burned by fires is declining but the number of major fires is increasing. In the United States, for example, the area burned has declined by more than 90% since 1930, while in Sweden the area burned annually fell from about 12,000 hectares in 1876 to about 400 hectares in 1989. In North America, however, the number of fire disasters10 or more people reportedly killed, 100 people reportedly affected, a declared state of emergency, and a call for international assistanceincreased from about 10 in the 1980s to about 45 during the 1990s (C16.2.2)."

At the same time, humankind has influenced and shaped its environment to enhance the availability of certain valued services. Recognizing that it is not possible to fully separate the different spiritual, intellectual, and physical links between human cultures and ecosystems, the MA assessed six main types of cultural and amenity services provided by ecosystems: cultural diversity and identity; cultural landscapes and heritage values; spiritual services; inspiration (such as for arts and folklore); aesthetics; and recreation and tourism. Because global aggregated information on the condition of cultural services was limited (with the partial exception of recreational and tourism benefits), the section below draws significantly on information in the MA sub-global assessments."

Throughout human evolution, human societies have developed in close interaction with the natural environment, which has shaped their cultural identity, value systems, and language.  The loss of particular ecosystem attributes (sacred species or sacred forests), combined with social and economic changes, can sometimes weaken the spiritual benefits people obtain from ecosystems in many parts of the world (C17.2.3). On the other hand, under some circumstances (such as where ecosystem attributes are causing significant threats to people) the loss of some attributes may enhance spiritual appreciation for what remains.  People across cultures and regions express, in general, an aesthetic preference for natural environments over urban or built ones; the conversion and degradation of relatively natural environments has diminished these benefits. Ecosystems continue to inspire arts, songs, drama, dance, design, and fashion, although the stories told through such media are different from those told historically (C17.2.5).  Recreation and tourism uses of ecosystems are growing, due to growing populations, greater leisure time available among wealthy populations, and greater infrastructure development to support recreational activities and tourism. Nature travel increased at an estimated rate of 1030% annually in the early 1990s, and in 1997 nature tourism accounted for approximately 20% of total international travel (C17.2.6). Tourism is now the primary economic development strategy for a number of developing countries.  Tourism is an important component of the economies of many of the MA sub-global assessment study areas, and at all scales most assessment stakeholders requested its inclusion. In contrast, spiritual, religious, recreational, and educational services tended to be assessed only at a fine scale in small local studies, typically because the data required for these assessments are not available at a broad scale and because of the culture-specific, intangible, and sometimes sensitive nature of these services (SG8.3).  Within the MA sub-global assessments, cultural services of tourism and recreation were generally in a good condition and growing, although some assessments expressed concerns about tourist activities potentially reducing the capacity of ecosystems to provide this cultural service (SG8.3).  In contrast, within the MA sub-global assessments localscale services of a spiritual nature are of a variable condition, typically either collapsing or being revived, depending on policies, interventions, and context-specific factors such as changes in leadership (SG8.3). Spiritual values were found to act as strong incentives for ecosystem conservation in subglobal assessments in Peru, Costa Rica, India, and some parts of Southern Africa. Educational services of ecosystems assessed in Sweden, Sao Paulo, and Portugal are all increasing due to growing levels of awareness of the value and benefits of, and thus the demand for, environmental education.  While provisioning services such as water, medicinal plants, fuelwood, and food are very important, spiritual and sacred elements in the local landscape also have a very specific and important value to local people across all the assessments. In several cases, spiritual values coincided with other values, such as biodiversity, water supply, biomedicines, and fuel (SG11.3)."

Cultural services increase in some scenarios and decline in others. Generally, cultural services decline moderately in Global Orchestration and strongly in Order from Strength, driven in both cases by lack of personal experience with nature and lower cultural diversity. Lower cultural diversity also drives a decline in cultural services in the TechnoGarden scenario. On the other hand, cultural services increase in Adapting Mosaic, due in part to the increase in knowledge systems and cultural diversity (S9.7)."

The cycles of several key nutrients have been substantially altered by human activities over the past two centuries, with important positive and negative consequences for a range of other ecosystem services and for human well-being. Nutrients are mineral elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that are essential as raw materials for organism growth and development. Ecosystems regulate the flows and concentrations of nutrients through a number of complex processes that allow these elements to be extracted from their mineral sources (atmosphere, hydrosphere, or lithosphere) or recycled from dead organisms. This service is supported by a diversity of different species."

Excess nutrients leak into the groundwater, rivers, and lakes and are transported to the coast. Treated and untreated sewage released from urban areas adds to the load (C.SDM).  In preindustrial times, the annual flux of nitrogen from the atmosphere to the land and aquatic ecosystems was roughly 110 210 teragrams of nitrogen a year. Human activity contributes an additional 165 teragams or so of nitrogen per year, roughly doubling the rate of creation of reactive N on the land surfaces of Earth (R9.2).

Phosphorus is also accumulating in ecosystems at a rate of 10.515.5 teragrams per year, compared with a preindustrial rate of 16 teragrams per year, mainly as a result of the use of phosphorus (obtained through mining) in agriculture. Most of this accumulation is in soils. If these soils erode into freshwater systems, deterioration of ecosystem services can result. This tendency is likely to spread and worsen over the next decades, since large amounts of P have been accumulated on land and their transport to water systems is slow and difficult to prevent (C12.ES).  Sulfur emissions have been progressively reduced in Europe and North America but not yet in the emerging industrial areas of the world: China, India, South Africa, and the southern parts of South America. A global assessment of acid deposition threats suggests that tropical ecosystems are at high risk (C12.ES).  Human actions at all scales required to feed the current world population have increased the leakiness of ecosystems with respect to nutrients. Tillage often damages soil structure, and the loss of biodiversity may increase nutrient leaching. Simplification of the landscape and destruction of riparian forests, wetlands, and estuaries allow unbuffered flows of nutrients between terrestrial and water ecosystems. Specific forms of biodiversity are critical to performing the buffering mechanisms that ensure the efficient use and cycling of nutrients in ecosystems (C12.ES).  In contrast to these issues associated with nutrient oversupply, there remain large parts of Earth, notably in Africa and Latin America, where harvesting without nutrient replacement has led to a depletion of soil fertility, with serious consequences for human nutrition and the environment (C12.ES)."

This is a consequence of increasing nitrogen inputs to surface water associated with urbanization, sanitation, development of sewerage systems, and lagging wastewater treatment, as well as increasing food production and associated inputs of nitrogen fertilizer, animal manure, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and biological nitrogen fixation in agricultural systems.

Biological diversity plays a critical role in underpinning ecosystem services. Governments supported the establishment of the MA through decisions taken by the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international conventions. The MA was initiated in 2001 under the auspices of the United Nations and governed by a multistakeholder board that included representatives of international institutions, governments, indigenous peoples, NGOs, and business. The secretariat was coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme. More than 1,360 scientists from 95 countries contributed to the assessment."

From the outset, the MA was designed to meet the needs of the Convention on Biological Diversity, among other users. The Conference of the Parties welcomed the contribution of the MA to the assessment work of the Convention. It encouraged Parties to participate in the MA and nominated the Chair of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical, and Technological Advice and the Executive Secretary to be represented on the MA Board. Parties to the CBD have provided review comments on underlying chapters of the assessment as well as this synthesis report. In addition, the penultimate draft of the synthesis report was presented to the tenth meeting of SBSTTA in February 2005, and the comments made there were taken into account in its finalization. As requested by the Conference of the Parties, SBSTTA will consider the final products of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment at its eleventh meetingincluding this synthesis report on biodiversityin order to prepare recommendations to the Conference of the Parties concerning the implications of the findings for the future work of the Convention."

Because the basis of all ecosystems is a dynamic complex of plants, animals, and microorganisms, biological diversity (or biodiversity, for short) has been a key component of the MA. The MA recognizes that interactions exist between people, biodiversity, and ecosystems. That is, changing human conditions drive, both directly and indirectly, changes in biodiversity, changes in ecosystems, and ultimately changes in the services ecosystems provide. Thus biodiversity and human wellbeing are inextricably linked. (See Figure A.) The MA also recognizes that many other factors independent of changes in biodiversity affect the human condition and that biodiversity is influenced by many natural forces that are not associated with humans."

These result in changes to biodiversity and to ecosystem services (lower left corner), thereby affecting human wellbeing. These interactions can take place at more than one scale and can cross scales. For example, international demand for timber may lead to a regional loss of forest cover, which increases flood magnitude along a local stretch of a river. Similarly, the interactions can take place across different time scales. Actions can be taken either to respond to negative changes or to enhance positive changes at almost all points in this framework. Local scales refer to communities or ecosystems and regional scales refer to nations or biomes, all of which are nested within global scale processes. Source: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment"

These were not designed to provide a scientific sample of any feature of ecosystems or human well-being. Instead, the choice of assessment locations was determined by a combination of interest in undertaking the assessment, interest in using the findings, and availability of resources to undertake the assessment. These assessments thus were primarily designed to meet needs of decision-makers in the locations where they were made, but they also informed the global MA findings with information and perspectives from the sub-global scale and vice versa. The MA also drew on information from 15 other sub-global assessments affiliated with the MA that met a subset of these criteria or were at earlier stages in development."

Changes in biodiversity due to human activities were more rapid in the past 50 years than at any time in human history, and the drivers of change that cause biodiversity loss and lead to changes in ecosystem services are either steady, show no evidence of declining over time, or are increasing in intensity. Under the four plausible future scenarios developed by the MA, these rates of change in biodiversity are projected to continue, or to accelerate.  Many people have benefited over the last century from the conversion of natural ecosystems to human-dominated ecosystems and from the exploitation of biodiversity. At the same time, however, these gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of losses in biodiversity, degradation of many ecosystem services, and the exacerbation of poverty for other groups of people.  The most important direct drivers of biodiversity loss and ecosystem service changes are habitat change (such as land use changes, physical modification of rivers or water withdrawal from rivers, loss of coral reefs, and damage to sea floors due to trawling), climate change, invasive alien species, overexploitation, and pollution.  Improved valuation techniques and information on ecosystem services demonstrate that although many individuals benefit from biodiversity loss and ecosystem change, the costs borne by society of such changes are often higher. Even in instances where knowledge of benefits and costs is incomplete, the use of the precautionary approach may be warranted when the costs associated with ecosystem changes may be high or the changes irreversible.  To achieve greater progress toward biodiversity conservation to improve human well-being and reduce poverty, it will be necessary to strengthen response options that are designed with the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as the primary goal. These responses will not be sufficient, however, unless the indirect and direct drivers of change are addressed and the enabling conditions for implementation of the full suite of responses are established.  Trade-offs between achieving the 2015 targets of the Millennium Development Goals and the 2010 target of reducing the rate of biodiversity loss are likely, although there are also many potential synergies between the various internationally agreed targets relating to biodiversity, environmental sustainability, and development. Coordinated implementation of these goals and targets would facilitate the consideration of trade-offs and synergies.  An unprecedented effort would be needed to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the rate of biodiversity loss at all levels.  Short-term goals and targets are not sufficient for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems. Given the characteristic response times for political, socioeconomic, and ecological systems, longerterm goals and targets (such as for 2050) are needed to guide policy and actions.  Improved capability to predict the consequences of changes in drivers for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and ecosystem services, together with improved measures of biodiversity, would aid decision-making at all levels.  Science can help ensure that decisions are made with the best available information, but ultimately the future of biodiversity will be determined by society."

At the same time, many other factors independent of the environment change the human condition, and many natural forces influence ecosystems.

For example, because biodiversity has many componentsincluding the diversity of all organisms, be they plants, animals, or microorganisms, the diversity within and among species and populations, and the diversity of ecosystemsno single component, whether genes, species, or ecosystems, is consistently a good indicator of overall biodiversity, as the components can vary independently."

Specifically, the value of the diversity of genes, species, or ecosystems per se is often confused with the value of a particular component of that diversity. Species diversity in and of itself, for example, is valuable because the presence of a variety of species helps to increase the capability of an ecosystem to be resilient in the face of a changing environment. At the same time, an individual component of that diversity, such as a particular food plant species, may be valuable as a biological resource. The consequences of changes in biodiversity for people can stem both from a change in the diversity per se and a change in a particular component of biodiversity. Each of these aspects of biodiversity deserves its own attention from decisionmakers, and each often requires its own (albeit connected) management goals and policies."

For example, the introduction of widespread weedy species to a continent such as Africa will increase the species diversity of Africa (more species present) while decreasing ecosystem diversity globally (since the ecosystems in Africa then become more similar in species composition to ecosystems elsewhere due to the presence of the cosmopolitan species). Because of the multiple levels of organization and multiple geographic scales involved, any single indicator, such as species diversity, is generally a poor indicator for many aspects of biodiversity that may be of concern for policy-makers."

Under this definition, biodiversity can be lost either if the diversity per se is reduced (such as through the extinction of some species) or if the potential of the components of diversity to provide a particular service is diminished (such as through unsustainable harvest).

The MA assesses the indirect and direct drivers of change in ecosystems and their services, the current condition of those services, and how changes in ecosystem services have affected human wellbeing. It uses a broad definition of human well-being, examining how ecosystem changes influence income and material needs, health, good social relations, security, and freedom of choice and action. The MA developed four global scenarios exploring plausible future changes in drivers, ecosystems, ecosystem services, and human well-being. (See Box 2.)

No scenario represents business as usual, although all begin from current conditions and trends. Both quantitative models and qualitative analyses were used to develop the scenarios.

Other drivers (such as rates of technological change and economic growth), ecosystem services (particularly supporting and cultural services, such as soil formation and recreational opportunities), and human well-being indicators (such as human health and social relations) were estimated qualitatively. In general, the quantitative models used for these scenarios addressed incremental changes but failed to address thresholds, risk of extreme events, or impacts of large, extremely costly, or irreversible changes in ecosystem services. These phenomena were addressed qualitatively by considering the risks and impacts of large but unpredictable ecosystem changes in each scenario."

Second, high rates of invasion by and introductions of species into new ranges are accelerating in pace with growing trade and faster transportation. Currently, documented rates of species introductions in most regions are greater than documented rates of extinction, which can lead to anomalous, often transient increases in local diversity.

In particular, poor people, particularly those in rural areas in developing countries, are more directly dependent on biodiversity and ecosystem services and more vulnerable to their degradation. Such biodiversity loss is equivalent to the loss of biological insurance or of alternative biological resources important for maintaining the flow of goods and services. Richer groups of people are often less affected by the loss of ecosystem services because of their ability to purchase substitutes or to offset local losses of ecosystem services by shifting production and harvest to other regions.

For instance, a steady increase in fishing pressure can cause abrupt changes in species populations in coastal ecosystems. An example of a regime shift in response to changes in multiple drivers is the case of tropical coral reefs, where nutrient loading, declines in herbivorous fish, and reef degradation collectively trigger shifts to algal-dominated systems. An example of instability caused by a change in biodiversity is that of the introduction of the invasive, carnivorous ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (a jellyfish-like animal) in the Black Sea, which caused the rapid loss of 26 major fisheries species and has been implicated (along with other factors) in the continued growth of the oxygen-deprived dead zone. The species was subsequently introduced into the Caspian and Aral Seas, where it is having similar impacts."

Despite this, in a number of these cases conversion was promoted because the cost associated with the loss of ecosystem services was not internalized, because the private gains were significant (although less than the public losses), and sometimes also because subsidies distorted the relative costs and benefits.

For virtually all these drivers, and for most ecosystems where they have been important, the impact of the driver currently remains constant or is growing. (See Figure 3.) Each of these drivers will have important impacts on biodiversity in the twenty-first century:  Habitat transformation, particularly from conversion to agriculture. Cultivated systems (areas where at least 30% of the landscape is in croplands, shifting cultivation, confined livestock production, or freshwater aquaculture) now cover one quarter of Earths terrestial surface. Under the MA scenarios, a further 10 20% of grassland and forestland is projected to be converted by 2050 (primarily to agriculture). While the expansion of agriculture and its increased productivity is a success story of enhanced production of one key ecosystem service, this success has come at high and growing costs in terms of trade-offs with other ecosystem services, both through the direct impact of land cover change and as a result of release of nutrients into rivers and water withdrawals for irrigation (globally, roughly 1535% of such irrigation withdrawals are estimated to be unsustainable (low to medium certainty). Habitat loss also occurs in coastal and marine systems, though these transformations are less well documented. Trawling of the seabed, for instance, can significantly reduce the diversity of benthic habitats, while destructive fishing and coastal development can lead to losses of coral reefs.  Overexploitation (especially overfishing). For marine systems, the dominant direct driver of change globally has been overfishing. Demand for fish as food for people and as feed for aquaculture production is increasing, resulting in increased risk of major, long-lasting collapses of regional marine fisheries. Over much of the world the biomass of fish targeted in fisheries (including that of both the target species and those caught incidentally) has been reduced by 90% relative to levels prior to the onset of industrial fishing. About three quarters (75%) of the worlds commercial marine fisheries are either fully exploited (50%) or overexploited (25%).  Biotic exchange. The spread of invasive alien species and disease organisms has increased because of increased trade and travel, including tourism. Increased risk of biotic exchange is an inevitable effect of globalization. While increasingly there are measures to control some of the pathways of invasive species for example, through quarantine measures and new rules on the disposal of ballast water in shippingseveral pathways are not adequately regulated, particularly with regard to introductions into freshwater systems.  Nutrient loading. Since 1950, nutrient loadinganthropogenic increases in nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and other nutrient-associated pollutantshas emerged as one of the most important drivers of ecosystem change in terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal ecosystems, and this driver is projected to increase substantially in the future (high certainty). For example, synthetic production of nitrogen fertilizer has been a key driver for the remarkable increase in food production during the last 50 years. Humans now produce more reactive (biologically available) nitrogen than is produced by all natural pathways combined."

Protected areas, including those managed primarily for biodiversity conservation and those managed for a wide range of sustainable uses, are extremely important, especially in environments where biodiversity loss is sensitive to changes in key drivers. PA systems are most successful if they are designed and managed in the context of an ecosystem approach, with due regard to the importance of corridors and interconnectivity of PAs and to external threats such as pollution, climate change, and invasive species. At the global and regional scales, however, the current system of protected areas is not sufficient for conservation of all (or even representative) components of biodiversity. PAs need to be better located, designed, and managed to deal with problems like lack of representativeness, impacts of human settlement within protected areas, illegal harvesting of plants and animals, unsustainable tourism, impacts of invasive species, and vulnerability to global change. Marine and freshwater ecosystems are even less well protected than terrestrial ones, although new developments in marine protected areas and PA networks show promise. Marine protected areas often provide striking examples of the potential synergies between conservation and sustainable use, since appropriately placed ones can significantly increase fishery harvests in adjoining areas. In all cases, better policy and institutional options are needed to promote the fair and equitable sharing of costs and benefits of protected areas at all levels.  Species protection and recovery measures for threatened species. Considerable scope exists to conserve and use biodiversity sustainably through more effective management of individual species. Although habitat-based approaches to species conservation are critical, they are by no means a replacement for species-based approaches, and likewise, species-based approaches are insufficient for habitat conservation.  Ex situ and in situ conservation of genetic diversity. The benefits from ex situ conservation of genetic diversity, such as genebanks, are substantial. While the technology continues to improve, the major constraint is ensuring that an adequate range of genetic diversity is contained within the ex situ facilities and that these remain in the public domain where, for example, they can serve the needs of poor farmers. In addition, significant benefits can be gained through better integration of ex situ and in situ conservation strategies, particularly for species that are difficult to maintain in ex situ facilities.  Ecosystem restoration. Ecosystem restoration activities are now common in many countries and include actions to restore almost all types of ecosystems, including wetlands, forests, grasslands, estuaries, coral reefs, and mangroves. Restoration will become an increasingly important response as more ecosystems become degraded and as demands for their services continue to grow. Ecosystem restoration, however, is generally far costlier than protecting the original ecosystem, and it is rare that all of the biodiversity and services of a system can be restored."

Market mechanisms have helped to conserve some aspects of biodiversity and to support its sustainable usefor example, in the context of ecotourism. In many countries, tax incentives, easements, tradable development permit programs, and contractual arrangements (such as between upstream landowners and those benefiting from watershed services) are becoming more common and have often been shown to be useful for conserving land and ecosystem services. Between 1996 and 2001, for example, Costa Rica provided $30 million to landowners to establish or protect over 280,000 hectares of forests and their environmental services. Similarly, carbon markets, which offer long-term gains in carbon sequestration, can provide incentives for conservation, especially if designed well such that they do not harm biodiversity conservation efforts. While more market-oriented approaches such as these show considerable promise, many challenges remain, such as the difficulty of obtaining the information needed to ensure that the buyers are indeed obtaining the services that they are paying for and the need to establish underlying institutional frameworks required for markets to work and ensure benefits are distributed in an equitable manner. Market reforms can be made to work better, and in a world of decentralized decision-making, improving market mechanisms may be essential to both sustainable use and conservation.  Incorporating considerations of biodiversity conservation into management practices in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Two types of opportunities exist. First, more diverse sys- tems of production can often be as effective as alternative low-diversity systems, or sometimes even more effective. For example, integrated pest management can increase biodiversity on farms, lower costs by reducing the need for pesticides, and meet the growing demand for organic food products. Second, strategies that promote the intensification of production rather than the expansion of the total area of production allow more area for conservation, as described later. Agricultural policy reforms in a number of countries are now beginning to take biodiversity into account, but much more can be done to reduce harmful impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services."

They have been most successful when they have simultaneously created incentives for local communities to make management decisions consistent with overall biodiversity conservation. However, while win-win opportunities for biodiversity conservation and local community benefits do exist, local communities can often achieve greater economic benefits from actions that lead to biodiversity loss. More generally, actions to increase income generation from biodiversity can provide incentives for conservation but can also lead to degradation without the appropriate enabling environment, which involves appropriate rights to the resources, access to information, and stakeholder involvement."

International agreements are indispensable for addressing ecosystem-related concerns that span national boundaries, but numerous obstacles weaken their current effectiveness. The limited, focused nature of the goals and mechanisms included in most bilateral and multilateral environmental treaties does not address the broader issue of ecosystem services and human well-being. Steps are now being taken to increase coordination among these treaties, and this could help broaden the focus of the array of instruments. However, coordination is also needed between the multilateral environmental agreements and the more politically powerful international legal institutions, such as economic and trade agreements, to ensure that they are not acting at cross-purposes.  Public awareness, communication, and education. Education and communication programs have both informed and changed preferences for biodiversity conservation and have improved implementation of biodiversity responses. Improved communication and education to the public and to decision-makers are essential to achieve the objectives of environmental conventions, sustainable development (including the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation), and sustainable management of natural resources more generally. While the importance of communication and education is well recognized, providing the human and financial resources to undertake effective work is a continuing barrier.  Enhancement of human and institutional capacity for assessing the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and acting on such assessments.

Issues of ownership and access to resources, rights to participation in decision-making, and regulation of particular types of resource use or discharge of wastes can strongly influence the sustainability of ecosystem management and are fundamental determinants of who wins and who loses from changes in ecosystems. Corruption, a major obstacle to effective management of ecosystems, also stems from weak systems of regulation and accountability. In addition, conditionality restrictions by multilateral agencies, such as Structural Adjustment Programs, have also created obstacles to effective ecosystem service management."

Some of the people benefiting from production subsidies (through either the low prices of products that result from the subsidies or as direct recipients) are poor and would be harmed by their removal. Compensatory mechanisms may be needed for these groups. Moreover, removal of agricultural subsidies within the OECD would need to be accompanied by actions designed to minimize adverse impacts on ecosystem services in developing countries. But the basic challenge remains that the current economic system relies fundamentally on economic growth that disregards its impact on natural resources.  Sustainable intensification of agriculture. The expansion of agriculture will continue to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss well into the twenty-first century. In regions where agricultural expansion continues to be a large threat to biodiversity, the development, assessment, and diffusion of technologies that could increase the production of food per unit area sustainably, without harmful trade-offs related to excessive consumption of water or use of nutrients or pesticides, would significantly lessen pressure on biodiversity. In many cases, appropriate technologies already exist that could be applied more widely, but countries lack the financial resources and institutional capabilities to gain and use these technologies. Where agriculture already dominates landscapes, the maintenance of biodiversity within these areas is an important component of total biodiversity conservation efforts, and, if managed appropriately, can also contribute to agricultural productivity and sustainability through the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides (such as through pest control, pollination, soil fertility, protection of water courses against soil erosion, and the removal of excessive nutrients).  Slowing and adapting to climate change. Significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are technically feasible due to an extensive array of technologies in the energy supply, energy demand, and waste management sectors. Reducing projected emissions will require the development and implementation of supporting institutions and policies to overcome barriers to the diffusion of these technologies into the marketplace, increased public and private-sector funding for research and development, and effective technology transfer. Given the inertia in the climate system, actions to facilitate the adaptation of biodiversity and ecosystems to climate change will also be necessary to mitigate negative impacts. These may include the development of ecological corridors or networks.  Addressing unsustainable consumption patterns. Consumption of ecosystem services and nonrenewable resources affects biodiversity and ecosystems directly and indirectly. Total consumption is a factor of per capita consumption, population, and efficiency of resource use. Slowing biodiversity loss requires that the combined effect of these factors be reduced.  Slowing the global growth in nutrient loading (even while increasing fertilizer application in regions where crop yields are constrained by the lack of fertilizers, such as parts of sub-Saharan Africa). Technologies already exist for reduction of nutrient pollution at reasonable costs, but new policies are needed for these tools to be applied on a sufficient scale to slow and ultimately reverse the increase in nutrient loading.  Correction of market failures and internalization of environmental externalities that lead to the degradation of ecosystem services. Because many ecosystem services are not formally traded, markets fail to provide appropriate signals that might otherwise contribute to the efficient allocation and sustainable use. In addition, many of the harmful trade-offs and costs associated with the management of one ecosystem service are borne by others and so are not weighed in sectoral decisions regarding the management of that service. In countries with supportive institutions in place, market-based tools could be more effectively applied to correct some market failures and internalize externalities, particularly with respect to provisioning ecosystem services. Various economic instruments or market-based approaches that show promise, in addition to the creation of new markets for ecosystem services and payments for ecosystem services noted earlier, include taxes or user fees for activities with external costs, capand-trade systems for reduction of pollutants, and mechanisms to allow consumer preferences to be expressed through markets (through certification schemes, for instance)."

At the same time, development plans can be more effective if they take into account existing plans and priorities for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.  Increased transparency and accountability of government and private-sector performance in decisions that affect ecosystems, including through greater involvement of concerned stakeholders in decision-making. Laws, policies, institutions, and markets that have been shaped through public participation in decision-making are more likely to be effective and perceived as just. Stakeholder participation also contributes to the decision-making process because it allows for a better understanding of impacts and vulnerability, the distribution of costs and benefits associated with trade-offs, and the identification of a broader range of response options that are available in a specific context. And stakeholder involvement and transparency of decision-making can increase accountability and reduce corruption.  Scientific findings and data need to be made available to all of society.

Ideally, to assess the conditions and trends of biodiversity either globally or sub-globally, it is necessary to measure the abundance of all organisms over space and time, using taxonomy (such as the number of species), functional traits (for example, the ecological type such as nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes versus nonnitrogen-fixing plants), and the interactions among species that affect their dynamics and function (predation, parasitism, competition, and facilitation such as pollination, for instance, and how strongly such interactions affect ecosystems). Even more important would be to estimate turnover of biodiversity, not just point estimates in space or time. Currently, it is not possible to do this with much accuracy because the data are lacking.

The estimated magnitude of background rates of extinction is roughly 0.11.0 extinctions per million species per year. Most measurements of this rate have come from assessing the length of species lifetimes through the fossil record: these range over 0.513 million years, and possibly 0.216 million years.

Ecological capital, further divided into biotic raw material (such as total species richness) and abiotic raw materials (such as soil nutrients), indicates the amount of resources available for providing services.  Ecological functioning (such as lake trophic status) measures the performance of ecosystems.

For example, biotic raw ecological capital measures the amount and variability of species within a defined area (C2.2.4).

That is, all species are weighted equally, which can lead assigning equal values to areas that have quite different biota. Moreover, the value of TSR depends on the definition of the area over which it was measured and may scale neither to smaller nor to larger areas. Finally, TSR does not differentiate between native and nonnative species, and the latter often include exotic, introduced, or invasive species that frequently disrupt key ecosystem services.

Regime shifts have been commonly documented in pelagic systems due to thresholds related to temperature regimes and overexploitation (C19.2.1, C18). Some regime shifts are essentially irreversible, such as coral reef ecosystems that undergo sudden shifts from coral-dominated to algal-dominated reefs (C19.5). The trigger for such phase shifts usually includes increased nutrient inputs leading to eutrophic conditions and removal of herbivorous fishes that maintain the balance between corals and algae. Once the thresholds (both an upper and a lower threshold) for the two ecological processes of nutrient loading and herbivory are passed, the phase shift occurs quickly (within months), and the resulting ecosystemthough stableis less productive and less diverse. Consequently, human well-being is affected not only by reductions in food supply and decreased income from reef-related industries (diving and snorkeling, aquarium fish collecting, and so on), but also by increased costs due to diminished ability of reefs to protect shorelines. (Algal reefs are more prone to being broken up in storm events, leading to shoreline erosion and seawater breaches of land) (C19.3).

These influence the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon, albedo (proportion of incoming radiation from the Sun that is reflected by the land surface back to space), evapotranspiration, temperature, and fire regimeall of which influence climate, especially at the landscape, ecosystem, or biome levels. For example, forests have higher evapotranspiration than other ecosystems, such as grasslands, because of their deeper roots and greater leaf area. Thus forests have a net moistening effect on the atmosphere and become a moisture source for downwind ecosystems. In the Amazon, for example, 60% of precipitation comes from water transpired by upwind ecosystems (C11.3.3)."

Landscape-level patches (>10 kilometers in diameter) that have lower albedo and higher surface temperature than neighboring patches create cells of rising warm air above the patch (convection). This air is replaced by cooler moister air that flows laterally from adjacent patches (advection). Climate models suggest that these landscape-level effects can substantially modify local-to-regional climate. In Western Australia, for example, the replacement of native heath vegetation by wheatlands increased regional albedo. As a result, air tended to rise over the dark (more solar-absorptive and therefore warmer) heathland, drawing moist air from the wheatlands to the heathlands. The net effect was a 10% increase in precipitation over heathlands and a 30% decrease in precipitation over croplands (C11.3.3)."

Biodiversity affects carbon sequestration primarily through its effects on species characteristics, which determine how much carbon is taken up from the atmosphere (assimilation) and how much is released into it (decomposition, combustion). Particularly important are how fast plants can grow, which governs carbon inputs, and woodiness, which enhances carbon sequestration because woody plants tend to contain more carbon, live longer, and decompose more slowly than smaller herbaceous plants. Plant species also strongly influence carbon loss via decomposition and their effects on disturbance. Plant traits also influence the probability of disturbances such as fire, windthrow, and human harvest, which temporarily change forests from accumulating carbon to releasing it (C11.3.3)."

The ocean, through its sheer volume and links to the terrestrial biosphere, plays a huge role in cycling of almost every material involved in biotic processes. Of these, the anthropogenic effects on carbon and nitrogen cycling are especially prominent. Biodiversity influences the effectiveness of the biological pump that moves carbon from the surface ocean and sequesters it in deep waters and sediments. Some of the carbon that is absorbed by marine photosynthesis and transferred through food webs to grazers sinks to the deep ocean as fecal pellets and dead cells. The efficiency of this trophic transfer and therefore the extent of carbon sequestration is sensitive to the species richness and composition of the plankton community (C11.4.3)."

Increasing associated biodiversity with low-diversity agroecosystems, however, can enhance biological control and reduce the dependency and costs associated with biocides.

For example, American oysters in Chesapeake Bay were once abundant but have sharply declinedand with them, their filtering ecosystem services. Areas like the Chesapeake might have much clearer water if large populations of filtering oysters could be reintroduced.

These studies are consistent with the understanding that market failures associated with ecosystem services lead to greater conversion of ecosystems than is economically justified. However, this finding would not hold at all locations. For example, the value of conversion of an ecosystem in areas of prime agricultural land or in urban regions often exceeds the total economic value of the intact ecosystem (although even in dense urban areas, the TEV of maintaining some green space can be greater than development of these sites) (C5).  Conversion of tropical forest to smallscale agriculture or plantations (Mount Cameroon, Cameroon). Maintenance of the forest with low-impact logging provided social benefits (NWFPs, sedimentation control, and flood prevention) and global benefits (carbon storage plus option, bequest, and existence values) across the five study sites totaling some $3,400 per hectare. Conversion to smallscale agriculture yielded the greatest private benefits (food production), of about $2,000 per hectare. Across four of the sites, conversion to oil palm and rubber plantations resulted in average net costs (negative benefits) of $1,000 per hectare. Private benefits from cash crops were only realized in this case because of market distortions.  Conversion of a mangrove system to aquaculture (Thailand). Although conversion for aquaculture made sense in terms of short-term private benefits, it did not once external costs were factored in. The global benefits of carbon sequestration were con- sidered to be similar in intact and degraded systems. However, the substantial social benefits associated with the original mangrove coverfrom timber, charcoal, NWFPs, offshore fisheries, and storm protectionfell to almost zero following conversion. Summing all measured goods and services, the TEV of intact mangroves was a minimum of $1,000 and possibly as high as $36,000 per hectare, compared with the TEV of shrimp farming, which was about $200 per hectare.  Draining freshwater marshes for agriculture (Canada). Draining freshwater marshes in one of Canadas most productive agricultural areas yielded net private benefits in large part because of substantial drainage subsidies. However, the social benefits of retaining wetlands arising from sustainable hunting, angling, and trapping greatly exceeded agricultural gains. Consequently, for all three marsh types considered, TEV was on average $5,800 per hectare, com- pared with $2,400 per hectare for converted wetlands.  Use of forests for commercial timber extraction (Cambodia). Use of forest areas for swidden agriculture and extraction of non-wood forest products (including fuelwood, rattan and bamboo, wildlife, malva nuts, and medicine) as well as ecological and environmental functions such as watershed, biodiversity, and carbon storage provided a TEV ranging of $1,3004,500 per hectare (environmental services accounted for $590 of that while NWFPs provided $7003,900 per hectare).

Currently, however, loss far exceeds origination, and rates are orders of magnitude higher than average rates in the past. Recall that biodiversity loss is not just global extinction, such as that faced by many threatened and endangered species, but declines in genetic, ecosystem, and landscape diversity are considered biodiversity loss as well. Even if every native species were retained in an ecological preserve, if the majority of the landscape has been converted to high-intensity monoculture cropland systems, then biodiversity has declined significantly.

The degree of extinction risk also tends to be similar among related species, leading to the likelihood that entire evolutionary radiations can and have been lost.

A driver is any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in an ecosystem. A direct driver unequivocally influences ecosystem processes. An indirect driver operates more diffusely, by altering one or more direct drivers. Important direct drivers affecting biodiversity are habitat change, climate change, invasive species, overexploitation, and pollution (CF4, C3, C4.3, S7)."

Changes are driven by combinations of drivers that work over time (such as population and income growth interacting with technological advances that lead to climate change) or level of organization (such as local zoning laws versus international environmental treaties) and that happen intermittently (such as droughts, wars, and economic crises). Reviews of case studies of deforestation and desertification reveal that the most common type of interaction is synergetic factor combinations: combined effects of multiple drivers that are amplified by reciprocal action and feedbacks (S7.4)."

Though some of the elements of these networks are global, the actual set of interactions that brings about an ecosystem change is more or less specific to a particular place. For example, a link between increasing producer prices and the extension of production can be found in many places throughout the world. The strength of this effect, however, is determined by a range of location-specific factors including production conditions, the availability of resources and knowledge, and the economic situation of the farmer (S7.4). No single conceptual framework captures the broad range of case study evidence about the interactions among drivers.

However, these reflect changes in indirect driversthe root causes of changes in ecosystems.

Global economic activity increased nearly sevenfold between 1950 and 2000 (S7.SDM), and in the MA scenarios it is projected to grow a further threeto sixfold by 2050. The many processes of globalization have amplified some driving forces of changes in ecosystem services and attenuated other forces by removing regional barriers, weakening national connections, and increasing the interdependence among people and between nations (S7.2.2).  Global population doubled in the past 40 years, reaching 6 billion in 2000 (S7.2.1). It is projected to grow to 8.19.6 billion by 2050, depending on the scenario. Urbanization influences consumption, generally increasing the demand for food and energy and thereby increasing pressures on ecosystems globally.  Over the past 50 years, there have been significant changes in sociopolitical drivers, including a declining trend in centralized authoritarian governments and a rise in elected democracies, which allows for new forms of management, in particular adaptive management, of environmental resources (S7.2.3)."

Fishing pressure is so strong in some marine systems that over much of the world the biomass of fish targeted in fisheries (including that of both the target species and those caught incidentally) has been reduced by 90% relative to levels prior to the onset of industrial fishing. In these areas a number of targeted stocks in all oceans have collapsedhaving been overfished or fished above their maximum sustainable levels. Recent studies have demonstrated that global fisheries landings peaked in the late 1980s and are now declining despite increasing effort and fishing power, with little evidence of this trend reversing under current practices (C18.3). In addition to the landings, the average trophic level of global landings is declining, which implies that we are increasingly relying on fish that originate from the lower part of marine food webs (C18.3).

The susceptibility of an ecological community to a given threat will depend on the events of the past that have shaped the current biota. If the current threats are novel, they will have dramatic effects on populations, since species will lack adaptations. Even if drivers are similar to past drivers (climate, for example, has always been variable to some degree), the intensity of some current-day drivers is unprecedented (such as the rates and extent of habitat change). Furthermore, todays drivers of extinction are often multipleland use change, emerging disease, and invasive species are all occurring together, for instance. Because exposure to one threat type often makes a species more susceptible to a second, exposure to a second makes a species more susceptible to a third, and so on, consecutive, multiple threats to species may have unexpectedly dramatic impacts on biodiversity (S7.4, C4.3)."

Natural sources of inertia correspond to the time scales inherent to natural systems; for example, recovery of a population cannot proceed more quickly than the average turnover or generation time, and established recovery will often take several generations. On top of this is anthropogenic inertia resulting from the time scales inherent in human institutions for decision-making and implementation. For most systems, these two sources of inertia will lead to delays of years, and more often decades, in slowing and reversing a declining biodiversity trend. This analysis assumes that the drivers of change could indeed be halted or reversed in the near term.

Overall, these results suggest that about half of the species losses may occur over a period of 100 to 1,000 years. Therefore, humans have the opportunity to deploy active habitat restoration practices that may rescue some of the species that otherwise would have been in a trajectory toward extinction.

Clear principles can help guide the parties to reach future agreement and guide the implementation of an agreement.  Elaborate obligations and appropriate rights. An agreement with a clear elaboration of obligations and rights is more likely to be implemented.  Provide financial resources. Availability of financial resources increases the opportunities for implementation.  Provide mechanisms for implementation. Where financial resources are not sufficient, market mechanisms may increase the potential for implementation.  Establish implementing and monitoring agencies. The establishment of subsidiary bodies with authority and resources to undertake specific activities to enhance the implementation of the agreements is vital to ensure continuity, preparation, and follow-up to complex issues.

Central to the rationale is that the full range of measures is applied in a continuum from strictly protected to human-made ecosystems and that integration can be achieved through both spatial and temporal separation across the landscape, as well as through integration within a site. The MA subglobal assessments highlight useful synergies and trade-offs where different responses are integrated into a coherent regional framework (SG9).

Many contributions to overall biodiversity protection are made from production landscapes or other lands outside of protected areas, and integration allows these contributions to be credited at the regional planning scale and to increase regional net benefits.

Numerous responses that address direct and indirect drivers would be particularly important for biodiversity and ecosystem services:  Elimination of subsidies that promote excessive use of specific ecosystem services. Subsidies paid to the agricultural sectors of OECD countries between 2001 and 2003 averaged over $324 billion annually, or one third the global value of agricultural products in 2000 (S7). These subsidies lead to overproduction, reduce the profitability of agriculture in developing countries, and promote overuse of fertilizers and pesticides. Similar problems are created by fishery subsidies, which amounted to approximately $6.2 billion in OECD countries in 2002, or about 20% of the gross value of production (S7). Although removal of perverse subsidies will produce net benefits, it will not be without costs. Some of the people benefiting from production subsidies (through either the low prices of products that result from the subsidies or as direct recipients of subsidies) are poor and would be harmed by their removal. Compensatory mechanisms may be needed for these groups. Moreover, removal of agricultural subsidies within the OECD would need to be accompanied by actions designed to minimize adverse impacts on ecosystem services in developing countries. But the basic challenge remains that the current economic system relies fundamentally on economic growth that disregards its impact on natural resources.  Promotion of sustainable intensification of agriculture (C4, C26). The expansion of agriculture will continue to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss well into the twenty-first century. In regions where agricultural expansion continues to be a large threat to biodiversity, the development, assessment, and diffusion of technologies that could increase the production of food per unit area sustainably, without harmful trade-offs related to excessive consumption of water or use of nutrients or pesticides, would significantly lessen pressure on biodiversity. In many cases, appropriate technologies already exist that could be applied more widely, but countries lack the financial resources and intuitional capabilities to gain and use these technologies. Where agriculture already dominates landscapes, the maintenance of biodiversity within these landscapes is an important component of total biodiversity conservation efforts, and, if managed appropriately, can also contribute to agricultural productivity and sustainability through the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides (such as through pest control, pollination, soil fertility, protection of water courses against soil erosion, and the removal of excessive nutrients).  Slowing and adapting to climate change (R13). By the end of the century, climate change and its impacts may be the dominant direct driver of biodiversity loss and change of ecosystem services globally. Harm to biodiversity will grow with both increasing rates in change in climate and increasing absolute amounts of change. For ecosystem services, some services in some regions may initially benefit from increases in temperature or precipitation expected under climate scenarios, but the balance of evidence indicates that there will be a significant net harmful impact on ecosystem services worldwide if global mean surface temperature increase more than 2o Celsius above preindustrial levels or faster than 0.2o Celsius per decade (medium certainty).

These may include the development of ecological corridors or networks.  Slowing the global growth in nutrient loading (even while increasing fertilizer application in regions where crop yields are constrained by the lack of fertilizers, such as parts of sub-Saharan Africa). Technologies already exist for reduction of nutrient pollution at reasonable costs, but new policies are needed for these tools to be applied on a sufficient scale to slow and ultimately reverse the increase in nutrient loading (R9).  Correction of market failures and internalization of environmental externalities that lead to the degradation of ecosystem services (R17, R10, R13). Because many ecosystem services are not traded in markets, markets fail to provide appropriate signals that might otherwise contribute to the efficient allocation and sustainable use of the services. In addition, many of the harmful trade-offs and costs associated with the management of one ecosystem service are borne by others and so also do not weigh into decisions regarding the management of that service. In countries with supportive institutions in place, market-based tools can be used to correct some market failures and internalize externalities, particularly with respect to provisioning ecosystem services.  Increased transparency and accountability of government and private-sector performance in decisions that affect ecosystems, including through greater involvement of concerned stakeholders in decision-making (RWG, SG9). Laws, policies, institutions, and markets that have been shaped through public participation in decision-making are more likely to be effective and perceived as just. Stakeholder participation also contributes to the decisionmaking process because it allows for a better understanding of impacts and vulnerability, the distribution of costs and benefits associated with trade-offs, and the identification of a broader range of response options that are available in a specific context. And stakeholder involvement and transparency of decisionmaking can increase accountability and reduce corruption.  Integration of biodiversity conservation strategies and responses within broader development planning frameworks. For example, protected areas, restoration ecology, and markets for ecosystem services will have higher chances of success if these responses are reflected in the national development strategies or in poverty reduction strategies, in the case of many developing countries. In this manner, the costs and benefits of these conservation strategies and their contribution to human development are explicitly recognized in the Public Expenditure Review and resources for the implementation of the responses can be set aside in national Mid-Term Budgetary Frameworks (R17).  Increased coordination among multilateral environmental agreements and between environmental agreements and other international economic and social institutions (R17). International agreements are indispensable for addressing ecosystem-related concerns that span national boundaries, but numerous obstacles weaken their current effectiveness. The limited, focused nature of the goals and mechanisms included in most bilateral and multilateral environmental treaties does not address the broader issue of ecosystem services and human well-being. Steps are now being taken to increase coordination among these treaties, and this could help broaden the focus of the array of instruments. However, coordination is also needed between the multilateral environmental agreements and the more politically powerful international legal institutions, such as economic and trade agreements, to ensure that they are not acting at cross-purposes.  Enhancement of human and institutional capacity for assessing the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and acting on such assessments (RWG). Technical capacity for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries management is still limited in many countries, but it is vastly greater than the capacity for effective management for ecosystem services not derived from these sectors.  Addressing unsustainable consumption patterns (RWG). Consumption of ecosystem services and nonrenewable resources affects biodiversity and ecosystems directly and indirectly. Total consumption is a factor of per capita consumption, population, and efficiency of resource use. Slowing biodiversity loss requires that the combined effect of these factors be reduced."

This is unlikely to be achieved globally for various reasons: current trends show few indications of slowing the rate of loss; most of the direct drivers of biodiversity loss are projected to increase; and inertia in natural and human institutional systems implies lags of years, decades, or even centuries between actions taken and their impact on biodiversity and ecosystems (C4, S7, S10, R5)."

Overall the rate of habitat lossthe main driver of biodiversity loss in terrestrial ecosystemsis slowing in certain regions and could slow globally if proactive approaches are taken (S10). This may not necessarily translate into lower rates of species loss, however, because of the nature of the relationship between numbers of species and area of habitat, because decades or centuries may pass before species extinctions reach equilibrium with habitat loss, and because other drivers of loss, such as climate change, nutrient loading, and invasive species, are projected to increase. While rates of habitat loss are decreasing in temperate areas, they are projected to continue to increase in tropical areas (C4, S10)."

Conservation of biodiversity is essential as a source of particular biological resources, to maintain different ecosystem services, to maintain the resilience of ecosystems, and to provide options for the future. These benefits that biodiversity provides to people have not been well reflected in decision-making and resource management, and thus the current rate of loss of biodiversity is higher than what it would be had these benefits been taken into account (R5).

Even if utilitarian benefits were taken fully into account, planet Earth would still be losing biodiversity, as other utilitarian benefits often compete with the benefits of maintaining greater diversity. Many of the steps taken to increase the production of specific ecosystem services require the simplification of natural systems (in agriculture, for example). Moreover, managing ecosystems without taking into account the full range of ecosystem services may not necessarily require the conservation of biodiversity. (For example, a forested watershed could provide clean water and timber whether it was covered by a diverse native forest or a single-species plantation, but a single-species plantation may not provide significant levels of many other services, such as pollination, food, and cultural services.) Ultimately, the level of biodiversity that survives on Earth will be determined to a significant extent by ethical concerns in addition to utilitarian ones (C4, C11, S10, R5)."

For example, improving rural road networksa common feature of hunger reduction strategieswill likely accelerate rates of biodiversity loss (directly through habitat fragmentation and indirectly by facilitating unsustainable harvests of bushmeat and so on). Moreover, one of the MA scenarios (Global Orchestration) suggests that future development paths that show relatively good progress toward the MDG of eradicating extreme poverty and improving health also showed relatively high rates of habitat loss and associated loss of species over 50 years. (See Figure 6.2.) This does not imply that biodiversity loss is, in itself, good for poverty and hunger reduction. Instead, it indicates that many economic development activities aimed at poverty reduction are likely to have negative impacts on biodiversity unless the value of biodiversity and related ecosystem services are factored in (S10, R19)."

Biodiversity loss is projected to continue for the foreseeable future (S10). The indirect drivers of biodiversity loss are related to economic, demographic, sociopolitical, cultural, and technological factors. Consumption of ecosystem services and of energy and nonrenewable resources has an impact, directly and indirectly, on biodiversity and ecosystems. Total consumption is a factor of per capita consumption, population, and efficiency of natural resource use. Halting biodiversity loss (or reducing it to a minimal level) requires that the combined effect of these factors in driving biodiversity loss be reduced (C4, S7)."

For some drivers, such as the overharvesting of particular species, lag times are rather short; for others, such as nutrient loading and, especially, climate change, lag times are much longer. Addressing the indirect drivers of change may also require somewhat longer time horizons given political, socioeconomic, and demographic inertias. Population is projected to stabilize around the middle of the century and then decrease. Attention also needs to be given to addressing unsustainable consumption patterns. At the same time, while actions can be taken to reduce the drivers and their impacts on biodiversity, some change is inevitable, and adaptation to such change will become an increasingly important component of response measures (C4.5.2, S7, R5)."

Ecosystems are both sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, aerosol precursors, and pollutants. Their physical properties affect heat and water fluxes, influencing temperature and precipitationaltering, for example, the reflection of solar radiation (albedo) and the flow of water through plants to the atmosphere (evapotranspiration), where it becomes available for rainfall. Thus ecosystems provide the following atmospheric services:  warming (for example, sources of greenhouse gases and reduction of albedo by boreal forests compared with bare soil and snow);  cooling (for example, sinks of greenhouse gases, sources of aerosols that reflect solar radiation, and evapotranspiration);  water recycling and regional rainfall patterns (for example, evapotranspiration and sources of cloud condensation nuclei);  atmospheric cleansing (for example, sinks for pollutants such as tropospheric ozone, ammonia, NOx, sulfur dioxide, and methane);  pollution sources (for example, particulates from biomass burning, NOx, carbon monoxide, and precursors of tropospheric ozone); and  nutrient redistribution (for example, source of nitrogen deposited elsewhere and reduction of erosion and nutrient-rich airborne dust compared with bare soil)."

The main drivers are deforestation, fertilizer use, and agricultural practices. Ecosystem changes account for about 1030% of the radiative forcing of carbon dioxide from 1750 to present and a large proportion of the radiative forcing due to methane and nitrous oxide. Ecosystems are currently a net sink for carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone, while they remain a net source of methane and nitrous oxide. Management of ecosystems has the potential to significantly modify concentrations of a number of greenhouse gases, although this potential is small in comparison to IPCC scenarios of fossil fuel emissions over the next century (high certainty). Ecosystems influence the main anthropogenic greenhouse gases in several ways:  Carbon dioxidePreindustrial concentration, 280 parts per million; concentration in 2000, 370 ppm. About 40% of the emissions over the last two centuries and about 20% of the CO2 emissions during the 1990s originated from changes in land use and land management, primarily deforestation. Terrestrial ecosystems have been a sink for about a third of cumulative historical emissions and a third of the 1990s total (energy plus land use) emissions. The sink may be explained partially by afforestation/ reforestation/forest management in North America, Europe, China, and other regions, and partially by the fertilizing effects of nitrogen deposition and increasing atmospheric CO2. Ecosystems were on average a net source of CO2 during the nineteenth and early twentieth century and became a net sink sometime around the middle of the last century (high certainty).  MethanePreindustrial concentration, 700 parts per billion; concentration in late 1990s, 1750 ppb. Natural processes in wetland ecosystems account for 2530% of current CH4 emissions, and about 30% of emissions are due to agriculture (ruminant animals and rice paddies)."

Deforestation and desertification in the tropics and sub-tropics leads to a reduction in regional rainfall (high certainty). The biophysical effects of ecosystem changes on climate depend on geographical location and season. With high certainty:  Deforestation in seasonally snow-covered regions leads to regional cooling during the snow season due to an increase in surface albedo and leads to warming during summer due to reduction in evapotranspiration.  Large-scale tropical deforestation (hundreds of kilometers) reduces regional rainfall, primarily due to decreased evapotranspiration.  Desertification in tropical and sub-tropical drylands leads to decrease in regional rainfall due to reduced evapotranspiration and increased surface albedo."

Figure A is the radiative forcing caused by changes in atmospheric composition, alteration in land surface reflectance (albedo), and variation in the output of the sun for the year 2000 relative to the conditions in 1750. The height of the bar represents a best estimate, and the accompanying vertical line a likely range of values. We have separated factors with a significant ecosystem influence from those without. The indirect effect of aerosols shown is their effect on cloud droplet size and number, not cloud lifetime. Some of the radiative components are well mixed over the globe, such as CO2, thereby perturbing the global heat balance. Others represent perturbations with stronger regional signatures because of their spatial distribution, such as aerosols. Radiative forcing continues to be a useful tool to estimate to a first order, the relative climate impacts such as the relative global mean surface temperature response due to radiatively induced perturbations, but these global mean forcing estimates are not necessarily indicators of the detailed aspects of the potential climate responses (e.g., regional climate change). Figure B is the relative contribution of ecosystems to sources, sinks, and net change of three of the main greenhouse gases. These can be compared by conversion into CO2equivalent values, based on the global warming potential (radiative impact times atmospheric lifetime) of the different gases. For CH4 and N2O, a 100-year time scale was assumed; a shorter time scale would increase the relative value compared with CO2 and a longer time scale would reduce it. Ecosystems are also a net sink for tropospheric ozone, but it is difficult to calculate emissions in CO2equivalent values."

Fossil fuel emissions from preindustrial times to 2000 are estimated as 280 PgC (Marland et al. 2000, update in Prentice et al. 2001), but the atmospheric increase during the same period was only 190 PgC.

In central Amazonia, model estimates for the first half of this century suggest annual fragmentation losses of 45 megagrams of carbon per hectare per year. Timber removal from extant Amazonian forests is likely to account for a loss equal to about 1020 megagrams of carbon per hectare per year, and fires for double that amount (Nepstad et al. 1999).

It remains uncertain how much carbon contained in soil eroded from agricultural landscapes is delivered to the atmosphere in policyrelevant timescales (Renwick et al. 2004). Actions taken to promote carbon sequestration in soils would reduce dust emissions, which have a fertilizing effect on the ocean, thus reducing the uptake of CO2 by the ocean and diminishing the effectiveness of this response strategy to an unknown degree (Ridgwell et al. 2002). Complex interactions of this type highlight the need to consider all implications of management options (see MA Policy Responses, Chapter 13).

Within this layer, vertical profiles of temperature and humidity depend strongly on the partitioning of energy between sensible heat and latent heat. Over land, this partitioning is largely controlled by ecosystems. Over bare, dry land, the energy is transported via sensible heat, resulting in relatively high surface air temperatures. Vegetation canopies transpire water extracted from the root zone, increase the upward latent heat flux, and cool the surface air (Avissar et al. 2004). Modification of the fluxes of water and energy by ecosystems has significant regional effects on precipitation, temperature, and wind. Globally averaged impacts are small, complex, and hard to detect against the background of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change. Key physical properties and processes affected by ecosystems are summarized here:  Surface albedo is the fraction of solar radiation reflected back into the atmosphere from Earths surface. Higher albedo means that more energy leaves the planetary boundary layer (net cooling of the atmosphere). Vegetation traps radiation, generally reducing albedo compared with, for instance, snow cover or bare ground in dry lands. In agricultural regions, tillage usually decreases albedo since bare soil in moist climates is generally darker (less reflective) than plant canopies. Forests are very effective at trapping radiation by multiple reflection"

(See Figure 13.8 in Appendix A.) Phytoplankton modify ocean surface albedo, with different types either reducing (Frouin and Lacobellis 2002) or increasing it (Brown and Yoder 1994; Balch et al. 1991).  Transpiration is the flux of water from the ground to the atmosphere through plants, controlled by the opening and closing of tiny pores in the leaf s surface called stomata. The volume of water transpired is determined by vegetation rooting depth, leaf area, soil moisture, temperature, wind, and stomatal conductance (which is biologically regulated). Transpiration drives the hydrological cyclerecycling rain water back to the atmosphere to be rained out elsewhere. Thus terrestrial ecosystems mediate the service of water recycling. Through transpiration and precipitation, water evaporated over the ocean is transported into the interior of continents. A part of the rainfall escapes immediate recycling and forms river runoff; thus the presence of vegetation reduces the fraction of rainfall going into runoff. (See Figure 13.9.) As runoff is part of the freshwater flux into the surface ocean, changes in terrestrial ecosystems can in principle affect ocean dynamics. Transpiration cools the surface during the daytime and increases air humidity in the near-surface atmospheric layer. Increased concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) leads to reduced fluctuations in the diurnal temperature cycle by increasing the night temperatures. Photosynthesis is tightly coupled to transpiration, but while increased atmospheric CO2 concentration in the future is likely to enhance photosynthesis, it may tend to reduce transpiration due to reduced stomatal conductance (medium certainty).  Cloud formation has strong but complex effects on global and regional climate (Stocker et al. 2001). Evapotranspiration determines the availability of water vapor for the formation of clouds. Clouds alter the radiation balance (low clouds are cooling while high cirrus clouds are warming), air circulation, and precipitation. Vegetation also affects cloud formation via changes in surface albedo and roughness. Some of the atmospheric constituents with ecosystem sources act as cloud condensation nuclei: in particular DMS emitted by marine plankton, VOCs emitted by some types of vegetation, and some aerosols emitted during biomass burning. Increased concentrations of CCNs produce more and smaller cloud droplets, making clouds more reflective and persistent; this has a cooling effect on Earth. In addition, such clouds tend to rise in the atmosphere, delaying the onset of rain; increasing ice formation, rainfall intensity, and lightning; creating more violent convective storms; and altering energy balances and air circulation (Andreae et al. 2004). The net effect on the total rainfall within a given area is unknown."

Increased DMS and VOC emissions increase CCNs, which reduces radiation and cools the planet; this in turn reduces photosynthesis and emissions of DMS and VOCs and increases thermal stability, thus reducing the probability of cloud formation in a negative feedback loop. The natural regulation mechanism is becoming overwhelmed by anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and deforestation. Some aerosols, such as soot particles, absorb sunlight, which cools the surface and heats the atmosphere, reducing cloud formation. ................. 11432$ CH13 10-11-05 14:58:30 PS"

For reference, (D) shows the absolute rate of evapotranspiration simulated with presentday vegetation.  The aerodynamic properties of the surface (roughness length) modify the strength and direction of the surface wind. On land, the height and cover of surface vegetation are the main determinants of roughness length.  Sea surface temperature is warmed by phytoplankton that trap radiation within the surface layer. A warmer surface reduces vertical mixing (ocean stratification) and ice cover, with potential feedbacks on regional circulation (Sathyendranath et al. 1991; Miller et al. 2003).

The change in vegetation from forest to pasture or crops increases surface albedo (leading to cooling of the atmosphere), decreases roughness, and reduces evapotranspiration (reducing rainfall and leading to local warming) (Henderson-Sellers et al. 1993). Measurable impacts can be expected when the area of deforestation is on a scale of a few hundred kilometers. Trees can get access to deep soil water and have been observed to maintain evapotranspiration through the dry season at levels equal to the wet season. Thus extensive deforestation generally leads to decreased regional rainfall (see Box 13.2), although under some conditions rainfall can be higher over areas with partial deforestation compared with areas with no deforestation (Durieux et al. 2003; Avissar et al. 2002). Since forest existence crucially depends on rainfall, the relationship between tropical forests and precipitation forms a positive feedback, which, under certain conditions, theoretically leads to the existence of two steady states: rainforest and savanna (Sternberg 2001; Oyama and Nobre 2003), although some models suggest only one stable climate-vegetation state in the Amazon (Claussen 1998)."

During the first five years, when Andrades property was mostly surrounded by forest, he would plant a brown bean crop at the end of the wet season. Even if rain was scarce, the seeds would germinate and the crops would grow because dew was very abundant during the nighttime, and the soil would be wet early in the morning.

If this effect occurs on a large scale, it will reduce latent heat flux and therefore increase land surface temperature (Sellers 1996). In some cases, agricultural leaf area index (the area of green leaf per unit area of ground) is higher than forest leaf area index, which will reduce the effect of decreased stomatal conductance on large-scale transpiration (Betts et al. 1997).

The larger pool of more chemically stable soil organic matter is potentially vulnerable to warming over longer time scales (Cramer et al. 2001; Joos et al. 2001; Knorr et al. 2005). The effect of global warming on vegetation cover is highly uncertain but likely also to affect atmospheric CO2. One coupled climate-carbon cycle model has predicted a dieback of tropical forests in South America, which, along with increased soil organic matter decomposition and subsequent carbon loss, would lead to an additional 200 ppm increase in atmospheric CO2 (Cox et al. 2000). Another model predicted a smaller feedback (Friedlingstein et al. 2001)."

Warming reduces the solubility of CO2 in the ocean. Stratification slows the mixing into deep layers of excess carbon in the surface water. Stratification further reduces nutrient input into the surface zone and leads to a prolonged residence time of phytoplankton at the surface, near light. Models indicate the net effect is reduced phytoplankton productivity (Bopp et al. 2001; Joos et al 1999). Models estimate that the combined effect of warming and circulation changes on ocean physics and biology will reduce the oceanic CO2 uptake by 625% in 19902050, thus providing a positive climate feedback (Maier-Reimer et al. 1996; Sarmiento et al. 1998; Matear and Hirst 1999; Joos et al. 1999, Bopp et al. 2001; Plattner et al. 2001)."

These include changes in the community structure, net production, and bio-calcification. The effect of bio-calcification is estimated to increase the ocean carbon sink by less than 2.5% (Riebesell et al. 2001). The quality and magnitude of biological changes will vary over space and time and is highly uncertain. While the combined inorganic and biological changes tend to reduce global uptake of anthropogenic carbon, the global net effect on carbon uptake of the ocean biological changes alone is unknown. Altered size and timing of phytoplankton blooms can also potentially reduce fish production (Chavez et al. 2003; Beaugrand et al. 2002; Platt et al. 2003)."

Measurements in Brunei in 1998 during a particularly severe haze episode caused mainly by local fires recorded many compounds, including VOCs (such as benzene and toluene), aldehydes, cresol, phenol, acetic acid, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and levels of particulates exceeding air quality guidelines (Muraleedharan et al. 2000). In 1994, the fires burning in Indonesia caused the visibility to drop to as low as 500 meters in Singapore. During the 1997 South East Asian smog episode, when particle levels in some areas were up to 15 times higher than normal, the Malaysian government was close to evacuating the 300,000 inhabitants of the city of Kuching (Brauer and Hisham-Hashim 1998), and the loss of an aircraft and 234 human lives in Sumatra was partially attributed to air traffic control problems caused by the smog.  On the Indonesian islands of Kalimantan and Sumatra during 1997 98, an estimated 9 million hectares of vegetation burned. Some 20 million people in Indonesia alone suffered from respiratory problems, mainly asthma, upper respiratory tract illness, and skin and eye irritation during the episode, with nearly four times as many acute respiratory illnesses as normal reported in South Sumatra (Heil and Goldammer 2001). A first assessment of costs of damages caused by the fire episode on 45 million hectares was $4.5 billion (shortterm health damages; loss of industrial production, tourism, air, ground and maritime transportation; fishing decline; cloud seeding and fire-fighting costs; losses of agricultural products, and timber; and direct and indirect forest benefits) (EEPSEA 1998).  The fires burning in Mexico during the 1998 episode forced the local government to shut down industrial production in order to decrease additional industrial pollution during the fire-generated smog. Daily production losses were about $8 million (Schwela et al. 1999).  In 2002, forest and peat fires in the Moscow region resulted in the worst haze seen in Moscow in 30 years. This has caused severe cardiovascular and respiratory problems among the population of Moscow, especially among children (GFMC 2003). has been a major source of CO2, only partially offset by reforestation, afforestation, and forest management activities and by the fertilizing effects of N and CO2. Immediately after deforestation, tropical soils are a source of N2O, although emissions decline to original level or below after 1520 years. Tropical forests are also an important source of VOCs; therefore deforestation reduces VOC emissions, although this will depend on the emission rate of the replacement vegetation. Deforestation reduces the sink for tropospheric ozone and N gases (Ganzeveld and Lelieveld 2004)."

Greenhouse gases emitted during fires are CO2, CH4 (510% of all sources), N2O, and tropospheric ozone precursors: NOx (just over 10% of all sources), CO (a quarter of all sources), and VOCs. Aerosols from biomass burning have a net cooling effect. Fire suppression reduces emissions from burning and encourages woody plant biomass to increase and act as a carbon sink. (In the United States, for example, this may have amounted to a sink of 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year during the 1980s (Houghton et al. 1999).) However, fire suppression can also increase the risk of future, catastrophic wildfires (Schwela et al. 1999).

Loss of biodiversity could further affect the adaptability and resilience of ecosystems and their ability to migrate with changing climate (Schulze and Mooney 1993; Tilman et al. 1997; Nepstad et al. 1999; Loreau et al. 2001; Kim Phat et al. 2004)."

For example, Smith et al. (2000) showed that elevated CO2 increased the success of an invasive C4 grass species in the Mojave Desert, potentially reducing biodiversity and altering ecosystem function. As with invasive tree species, this functional shift from grass to trees will also affect biophysical properties, biodiversity, and sources/sinks of various trace gases. Trees are not always the winners; for example, lianas respond more strongly than trees to the fertilizing effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration (Condon et al. 1992; Granados and Koner 2002; Phillips et al. 2002.). Lianas enhance tree mortality and suppress tree growth, which could ultimately reduce carbon storage in forests."

Diatom-dominated phytoplankton communities were replaced by extensive coccolithophorid blooms in the Barents Sea and the eastern Bering Sea (Smyth et al. 2004), causing massive changes in ecosystem structure. With coccolithophores being predominant producers of DMS, the observed regime shifts are likely to have altered the sulfur cycle and cloud formation in these areas, affecting air quality and water recycling."

This process releases CO2 to the ambient seawater, countering part of the photosynthetic CO2 drawdown (that is, the drawdown of CO2 by coccolithophorids is much smaller than that of non-calcifying phytoplankton). A shift in species composition away from coccolithophorids, for example due to changes in ocean acidity, would increase the oceans CO2 storage capacity. On the other hand, biogenic particles containing CaCO3 and SiO2 sink faster than other particles, which implies that the plankton (coccolithophorids and diatoms) producing these two minerals should increase the drawdown of carbon from surface to depth in the ocean. Thus shifts in composition of the marine ecosystems have the potential to influence the oceanic carbon sink (Francois et al. 2002; Klaas and Archer 2002), but at present we cannot quantify the probability, extent, or direction of the likely future changes or their consequences for climate."
