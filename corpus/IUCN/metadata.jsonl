Second, while conservation and stewardship certainly require considering the problems created by human impacts, they can also draw on the considerable potential of humans to solve a range of environmental challenges. Global sustainability requires corresponding responses at a global level. Equally, there is a need for bottom-up change.

This means that taking a proactive and diligent approach to environmental management is a vital part of the sport sector\u2019s licence to operate as well as growing and sustaining fan bases. Biodiversity conservation should be a key element in any environmentally responsible approach to sports event management. These guidelines focus on the often complex links between biodiversity and sport, and highlight that sports events can also benefit biodiversity. Each event offers an opportunity to raise public awareness of the value of nature and influence attitudes towards biodiversity and its conservation. These guidelines provide an overview of the issues and risks. They also offer help on how to make informed choices in avoiding harmful impacts and achieving posit", "year": "2020-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"}

This publication establishes that these patterns of gender-based abuse are observed across environmental contexts, affecting the security and well-being of nations, communities and individuals, and jeopardising meeting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While linkages between GBV and environmental issues are complex and multi-layered, these threats to human rights and healthy ecosystems are not insurmountable. This analysis reveals the complex and interlinking nature of GBV across three main contexts: access to and control of natural resources; environmental pressure and threats; and environmental action to defend and conserve ecosystems and resources. This publication aims to raise awareness and engage actors working in environmental and sustainable develo", "year": "2020-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"}

While many industries are taking steps to reduce their dependence on plastic, there is currently no reliable methodology to forecast specifically the extent of the marine plastic leakage from an industry or a country and map potential leakage hotspots throughout the value chain. This report offers, for the first time, a comprehensive framework to measure the inventory of marine plastic leakage, step-by-step and using a life-cycle perspective. It also offers generic data that can be used to calculate marine plastic leakage for a defined list of identified sources, including plastic waste, textile fibres, tyre dust, micro beads in cosmetics, and fishing nets. The approach discussed in this report focuses on inventorying plastic flows into the marine environment only. It does not look at plastic releases into the terrestrial environment, or any ecosystem or human health impacts that may result from marine plastic leakage.", "year": "2020-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"}
