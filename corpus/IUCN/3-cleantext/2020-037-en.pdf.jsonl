Plants and animals have morphological, ecophysiological, and life-history traits that promote persistence under summer droughts, nutrient poverty, and recurring fires, which play a role in top-down regulation. Stomatal regulation and root architecture promote drought tolerance in plants. Cluster roots and acid exudates, mycorrhizae and insectivory promote nutrient capture, while cellulose, lignin, exudate production and leaf longevity promote nutrient conservation in plants. Vertebrate herbivores and granivores possess specialised dietary and digestive traits enabling consumption of foliage with low nutrient content and secondary compounds. Decomposition rates are slow, allowing litter-fuel accumulation to add to well-aerated fine fuels in shrub canopies. Life-history traits, such as recovery organs, serotiny, post-fire seedling recruitment, pyrogenic flowering and firerelated germination cues, promote plant survival, growth and reproduction under recurring canopy fires. Animals evade fires in burrows or through mobility. Animal pollination syndromes are common (notably dipterans, lepidopterans, birds, and sometimes mammals) and ants may be prominent in seed dispersal.", "sentences": [{"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S1", "text": "Sclerophyllous, evergreen shrublands are distinctive ecosystems of humid and subhumid climates in mid-latitudes."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S2", "text": "Their low-moderate productivity is fuelled by autochthonous energy sources and is limited by resource constraints and/or recurring disturbance."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S3", "text": "Vegetation is dominated by shrubs with very low SLA, high C:N ratios, shade-intolerance, and long-lived, small, often ericoid leaves, with or without a low, open canopy of sclerophyll trees."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S4", "text": "The ground layer may include geophytes and sclerophyll graminoids, although less commonly true grasses."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S5", "text": "Trophic webs are simple, with large mammalian predators scarce or absent, and low densities of vertebrate herbivores."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S6", "text": "Native browsers may have local effects on vegetation."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S7", "text": "Diversity and local endemism may be high among vascular plants and invertebrate consumers."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S8", "text": "Plants and animals have morphological, ecophysiological, and life-history traits that promote persistence under summer droughts, nutrient poverty, and recurring fires, which play a role in top-down regulation."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S9", "text": "Stomatal regulation and root architecture promote drought tolerance in plants."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S10", "text": "Cluster roots and acid exudates, mycorrhizae and insectivory promote nutrient capture, while cellulose, lignin, exudate production and leaf longevity promote nutrient conservation in plants."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S11", "text": "Vertebrate herbivores and granivores possess specialised dietary and digestive traits enabling consumption of foliage with low nutrient content and secondary compounds."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S12", "text": "Decomposition rates are slow, allowing litter-fuel accumulation to add to well-aerated fine fuels in shrub canopies."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S13", "text": "Life-history traits, such as recovery organs, serotiny, post-fire seedling recruitment, pyrogenic flowering and firerelated germination cues, promote plant survival, growth and reproduction under recurring canopy fires."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S14", "text": "Animals evade fires in burrows or through mobility."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG71.PA5.S15", "text": "Animal pollination syndromes are common and ants may be prominent in seed dispersal."}], "entities": []}

Vegetation cover varies with soil conditions from near zero to >50% in upland grasslands and shrublands, but is generally low in stature. The dominant plants are perennial C3 grasses and xeromorphic suffrutescent or nonsclerophyllous perennial shrubs. Dwarf shrubs, tending to prostrate or cushion forms occur in areas exposed to strong, cold winds. Plant growth occurs mainly during warming spring temperatures after winter soil moisture recharges.

Plants have traits to protect buds, leaves and reproductive tissues from diurnal cold and transient desiccation stress, including ramulose (i.e. many-branched), cushion and rosette growth forms, insulation from marcescent (i.e. dead) leaves or pectin fluids, diminutive leaf sizes, leaf pubescence, water storage in stem-pith, and vegetative propagation. Most plants are long-lived and some rosette forms are semelparous. Cuticle and epidermal layers reduce UV-B transmission to photosynthetic tissues.

Their very low productivity is constrained by the scarcity of light, nutrients, and water, and sometimes also by high temperatures. Diversity is low and the trophic network is truncated, supporting microscopic bacteria, archaea, viruses and unicellular eukaryotes. Most are detritivores or lithoautotrophs, which derive energy, oxidants, carbohydrates and simple organic acids from carbon dioxide, geological sources of hydrogen and mineral compounds of potassium, iron and sulphur. Some fissures are large enough to support small eukaryotic predators such as nematodes. Photoautotrophs are present only in the surface layers of exposed rocks. Sampling suggests that these systems harbour 95% of the worlds prokaryote life, with rocks below the deep oceans and continents containing similar densities of cells and potentially accounting for a significant proportion of sequestered carbon. Endolithic microbes are characterised by extremely slow reproductive rates, especially in deep sedimentary rocks, which are the most oligotrophic substrates. At some depth within both terrestrial and marine substrates, microbes are sustained by energy from organic matter that percolates through fissures from surface systems. In deeper or less permeable parts of the crust, however, lithoautotrophic microbes are the primary energy synthesisers that sustain heterotrophs in the food web.

Diversity is low and the trophic network is truncated, supporting microscopic bacteria, archaea, viruses and unicellular eukaryotes. Most are detritivores or lithoautotrophs, which derive energy, oxidants, carbohydrates and simple organic acids from carbon dioxide, geological sources of hydrogen and mineral compounds of potassium, iron and sulphur. Some fissures are large enough to support small eukaryotic predators such as nematodes. Photoautotrophs (i.e. cyanobacteria) are present only in the surface layers of exposed rocks. Sampling suggests that these systems harbour 95% of the worlds prokaryote life (bacteria and archaea), with rocks below the deep oceans and continents containing similar densities of cells and potentially accounting for a significant proportion of sequestered carbon. Endolithic microbes are characterised by extremely slow reproductive rates, especially in deep sedimentary rocks, which are the most oligotrophic substrates. At some depth within both terrestrial and marine substrates, microbes are sustained by energy from organic matter that percolates through fissures from surface systems.

Kelp canopies host a diverse epiflora and epifauna, with some limpets having unique kelp hosts. Assemblages of benthic invertebrate herbivores and detritivores inhabit the forest floor, notably echinoderms and crustaceans. The structure and diversity of life in kelp canopies provide forage for seabirds and mammals, such as gulls and sea otters, while small fish find refuge from predators among the kelp fronds. Herbivores keep epiphytes in check, but kelp sensitivity to herbivores makes the forests prone to complex trophic cascades when declines in top predators release herbivore populations from top-down regulation. This may drastically reduce the abundance of kelps and dependent biota, and lead to replacement of the forests by urchin barrens, which persist as an alternative stable state.", "raw_text": "ECOLOGICAL TRAITS: Kelps are benthic brown macroalgae (Order Laminariales) forming canopies that shape the structure and function of these highly productive, diverse ecosystems.

Assemblages of benthic invertebrate herbivores and detritivores inhabit the forest floor, notably echinoderms and crustaceans. The structure and diversity of life in kelp canopies provide forage for seabirds and mammals, such as gulls and sea otters, while small fish find refuge from predators among the kelp fronds. Herbivores keep epiphytes in check, but kelp sensitivity to herbivores makes the forests prone to complex trophic cascades when declines in top predators release herbivore populations from top-down regulation. This may drastically reduce the abundance of kelps and dependent biota, and lead to replacement of the forests by urchin barrens, which persist as an alternative stable state.", "sentences": [{"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S1", "text": "Kelps are benthic brown macroalgae forming canopies that shape the structure and function of these highly productive, diverse ecosystems."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S2", "text": "These large, fast-growing autotrophs produce abundant consumable biomass, provide vertical habitat structure, promote niche diversity, alter light-depth gradients, dampen water turbulence and moderate water temperatures."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S3", "text": "Traits, such as large, flexible photosynthetic organs, rapid growth and strong benthic holdfasts enable kelps to persist on hard substrates in periodically turbulent waters."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S4", "text": "These kelps may occur as scattered individuals in other ecosystem types, but other macroalgae rarely form canopies with similar function and typically form mixed communities with sessile invertebrates."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S5", "text": "Some kelps are fully submerged, while others form dense canopies on the water surface, which profoundly affect light, turbulence and temperature in the water column."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S6", "text": "Interactions among co-occurring kelps are generally positive or neutral, but competition for space and light is an important evolutionary driver."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S7", "text": "Kelp canopies host a diverse epiflora and epifauna, with some limpets having unique kelp hosts."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S8", "text": "Assemblages of benthic invertebrate herbivores and detritivores inhabit the forest floor, notably echinoderms and crustaceans."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S9", "text": "The structure and diversity of life in kelp canopies provide forage for seabirds and mammals, such as gulls and sea otters, while small fish find refuge from predators among the kelp fronds."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S10", "text": "Herbivores keep epiphytes in check, but kelp sensitivity to herbivores makes the forests prone to complex trophic cascades when declines in top predators release herbivore populations from top-down regulation."}, {"id": "aa2e2fc06b027a2234c65ff7b7b3095a9357cc32911d61c920eb54f07a000e12.PG152.PA5.S11", "text": "This may drastically reduce the abundance of kelps and dependent biota, and lead to replacement of the forests by urchin barrens, which persist as an alternative stable state."}], "entities": []}

In situ primary production is contributed primarily by microphytobenthos, mainly benthic diatoms with green microalgae, as macrophytes are scarce or absent. Both decline with depth as light diminishes. Drift algae can be extensive over muddy sediments, particularly in sheltered waters. Abundant heterotrophic microbes process detritus. The microbial community mediates most of the biogeochemical cycles in muddy sediments, with features distinguishing these ecosystems from subtidal sand beds. Deposit feeders are important components of the trophic network, as the low kinetic energy environment promotes vertical food fluxes, which they are able to exploit more effectively than suspension-feeders. The latter are less abundant on subtidal mud plains than on rocky reefs and Subtidal sand beds, where waters are more turbulent and generate stronger lateral food fluxes. Deposit feeders may also constrain the abundance of cooccurring suspension-feeders by disturbing benthic sediment that resettles and smothers their larvae and clogs their filtering structures. Nonetheless, suspension-feeding tube worms may be common over muddy sediments when settlement substrates are available. Although such interference mechanisms may be important, competition is generally weak. In contrast, foraging predators, including demersal fish, may have a major structuring influence on these systems through impacts on the abundance of infauna, particularly on settling larvae and recently settled juveniles, but also adults.

Both decline with depth as light diminishes. Drift algae can be extensive over muddy sediments, particularly in sheltered waters. Abundant heterotrophic microbes process detritus. The microbial community mediates most of the biogeochemical cycles in muddy sediments, with features distinguishing these ecosystems from subtidal sand beds (M1.7). Deposit feeders (notably burrowing polychaetes, crustaceans, echinoderms and molluscs) are important components of the trophic network, as the low kinetic energy environment promotes vertical food fluxes, which they are able to exploit more effectively than suspension-feeders. The latter are less abundant on subtidal mud plains than on rocky reefs (M1.6) and Subtidal sand beds (M1.7), where waters are more turbulent and generate stronger lateral food fluxes. Deposit feeders may also constrain the abundance of cooccurring suspension-feeders by disturbing benthic sediment that resettles and smothers their larvae and clogs their filtering structures. Nonetheless, suspension-feeding tube worms may be common over muddy sediments when settlement substrates are available. Although such interference mechanisms may be important, competition is generally weak. In contrast, foraging predators, including demersal fish, may have a major structuring influence on these systems through impacts on the abundance of infauna, particularly on settling larvae and recently settled juveniles, but also adults.

Most energy is supplied to these ecosystems from allochthonous sources, either passively via currents or actively through addition by humans (as is the case in aquaculture). Epibenthic and planktonic marine algae, however, make a contribution to the energy budget through local primary production. Microbial decomposers and invertebrate detritivores in the sediments beneath and around the structures feed on particulate organic matter from the epibenthic biota (e.g. waste products and decaying bodies) or on unconsumed food delivered to managed species.
