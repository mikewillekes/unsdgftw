The three CFis in KRA are aligned with specified targets and timings within Cambodias national Strategic Planning Framework for Fisheries 2010-2019.  These CFis represent community fisheries interests within the Technical Working Group of KRA-MFMA, which meets on a quarterly basis and provides a platform for cross-sectoral engagement across multiple stakeholders including government, fishers, enforcement agencies and conservation organisations.

This ensured that fisher knowledge was considered and incorporated into all management strategies for the area.  The three CFis formed an enforcement team and received training in order to conduct SMART patrols as part of monitoring, control and surveillance activities within their own fishing areas.

The project applied an ecosystem-based management approach, combined with common pool resource management principles and a highly participatory approach to achieve sustainable conservation and livelihood benefits in these communities.  It included development and implementation of Fish Conservation Areas at three pilot sites where fishing was to be prohibited year round to protect key fish refugia.  The criteria for zoning a FCA were: o An ecologically important area; o Small size <100 ha; o As close as possible to a village centre; o An area undisturbed from human activities.

Some of the key interventions completed with success were: o Successful establishment of 3 Fish Conservation Areas; o FCA boundary demarcation and signboards; o Developed patrol plans for protecting the FCA; o Fish habitat improvement via Fish Attraction Devices; o Training a Community Fisheries committee on Participatory engagement; o Developed Community Fisheries by-laws and Management Plan s.  The key impacts from the project included: o Increased awareness on benefits of FCA management for local community; o Increased public awareness on FCA; o Increased fish stock around and inside the FCA; o Improved food security for local community; o Improved livelihoods of local fisherfolks; o Local capacity building.

The criteria for zoning a FCA were: o An ecologically important area; o Small size <100 ha (100-200 ha, located in open space); o As close as possible to a village centre; o An area undisturbed from human activities.  The process followed in establishing the FCA was: o Step 1: Local consultation  introduction of the concept of zoning to the local community. o Step 2: Provincial consultation  approval at subnational level to erect temporary boundary poles with participation from local key stakeholders. o Step 3: Submit for approval from the National Fisheries Administration / Ministry of Environment. o Step 4: Commence building FCA boundary poles and post signboards.  Some of the key interventions completed with success were: o Successful establishment of 3 Fish Conservation Areas; o FCA boundary demarcation and signboards; o Developed patrol plans for protecting the FCA; o Fish habitat improvement via Fish Attraction Devices; o Training a Community Fisheries committee on Participatory engagement; o Developed Community Fisheries by-laws and Management Plan s.  The key impacts from the project included: o Increased awareness on benefits of FCA management for local community; o Increased public awareness (both local and outsider) on FCA; o Increased fish stock around and inside the FCA; o Improved food security for local community; o Improved livelihoods of local fisherfolks; o Local capacity building.

An ongoing and continuous database of FK has been developed, supporting stock assessment and allowing users to access valuable information and monitor the status of populations of target organisms. FK is one of the key indicators that enable fishers to evaluate the total fish catch obtained annually.  This initiative is the first of its kind conducted by an organization of artisanal fishermen in Costa Rica.  The compiled information also permits the identification of fluctuation in the patterns of catch and effort in different marine and coastal locations over time, along with changes in perceived earnings from fishing.  Through the database fishers are able to objectively compare variation in yield from year to year and to understand the potential causes for improvements or declines in productivity in a particular year.  This supports with the understanding of the yield of fishing activities, which compares annual productivity, the effort invested in terms of time and in terms of the amount of equipment used.  FK goes beyond the commercial interest in species to become a real asset for the ecosystem management of their marine territory.  The project includes recording of developmental data of captured individuals of spotted rose snapper, whitefin weakfish and white snook..  The process of processing and systematizing this enormous basket of knowledge requires time and adaptation to fishers conditions and needs.  Data analysis and registration in the hands of fishers organizations provides them with a very strong negotiating power and enables fishers to compare and query government stock assessment data.  Small-scale fisheries have a very heterogeneous base of species that are important not only for the commercial interest but also for food security in the communities; FK considers the diversity of the ecosystem.  Accompanying agreements between organizations for the analysis of the data and improvement of the systematization methods is important and needs to be developed on a long term basis.  Fishers organizations can understand the economic and time value of the systematization of their knowledge, with their knowledge able to be used in the management of the fishery.  Using FK in fisheries management has enabled fishers to find different species faster and in the right location through assessment of annual data.  In the case of Tarcoles the type of information provided by the fishers included: Name of fisher, Location, type of fishing gear, Time fishing and added to this the moon phase and the date.
