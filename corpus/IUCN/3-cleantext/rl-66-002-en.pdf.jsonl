Afrithelphusa monodosa lives in farmland, swamps, and year-round wetland habitats in the semi-deciduous moist forest Guinea savanna zone of north-western Guinea. Specimens were collected from cultivated land from burrows dug into permanently moist soil, each with a shallow pool of water at the bottom. The natural habitat is still unknown but presumably this cultivated land was originally a permanent freshwater marsh. There were no nearby sources of surface water and it is evident that these crabs do not need to be immersed in water. Afrithelphusa monodosa can stay hydrated with the small amount of muddy water that collects at the bottom of its burrow. This species is clearly a competent air-breather. Despite the recent discovery of a new population of this species in 2005, it is still currently known from only a few specimens from two localities. Threats to the species include habitat loss/degradation due to human population increases, deforestation, and associated increased agriculture in north-west Guinea.

Afrithelphusa monodosa lives in farmland, swamps, and year-round wetland habitats in the semi-deciduous moist forest Guinea savanna zone of north-western Guinea (Cumberlidge, 1999). Specimens were collected from cultivated land from burrows dug into permanently moist soil, each with a shallow pool of water at the bottom. The natural habitat is still unknown but presumably this cultivated land was originally a permanent freshwater marsh. There were no nearby sources of surface water and it is evident that these crabs do not need to be immersed in water (as do their relatives in the genus Liberonautes that live in streams and rivers). Afrithelphusa monodosa can stay hydrated with the small amount of muddy water that collects at the bottom of its burrow. This species is clearly a competent air-breather. Despite the recent discovery of a new population of this species in 2005, it is still currently known from only a few specimens from two localities. Threats to the species include habitat loss/degradation (human induced) due to human population increases, deforestation, and associated increased agriculture in north-west Guinea.
