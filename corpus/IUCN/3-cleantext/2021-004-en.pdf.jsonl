Examples of potentially suitable offset sites include those already identified as national conservation priorities (e.g. the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans (NBSAPs) or international conservation priorities, particularly World Heritage Sites, Ramsar Sites and Key Biodiversity Areas, including BirdLife Internationals Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas). Offsets may also operate at a broader scale or at policy level rather than being strictly site-based (e.g. anti-poisoning programmes or powerline retrofitting to reduce bird of prey mortality, or improved regulation and enforcement to reduce seabird or cetacean bycatch in fisheries; see Table 7-1). In all cases, the offset will need to meet the offset principles (Box 17) to be acceptable, including that it is additional (i.e. would not have happened without the offset) and comparable (presents a fair exchange for the biodiversity lost). Additionality is a particular concern where offsets aim to help improve protection and management of existing but under-resourced protected areas (Annex 2, case study 18). In such cases, it needs to be clear that offset funding is not replacing other potential conservation investment or enabling cost-shifting by governments.", "sentences": [{"id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.S0", "text": "Table 7-2 gives examples of offset approaches for wind and solar."}, {"id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.S1", "text": "Many other interventions may be possible, depending on context and the species or ecosystems impacted  offset design gives scope for creativity, providing the offset actions are feasible and effective."}, {"id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.S2", "text": "Offsets aimed at protecting threatened and/or degraded areas would ideally contribute to national or international conservation priorities."}, {"id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.S3", "text": "Examples of potentially suitable offset sites include those already identified as national conservation priorities (e.g. the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans or international conservation priorities, particularly World Heritage Sites, Ramsar Sites and Key Biodiversity Areas, including BirdLife Internationals Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas)."}, {"id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.S4", "text": "Offsets may also operate at a broader scale or at policy level rather than being strictly site-based."}, {"id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.S5", "text": "In all cases, the offset will need to meet the offset principles to be acceptable, including that it is additional and comparable."}, {"id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.S6", "text": "Additionality is a particular concern where offsets aim to help improve protection and management of existing but under-resourced protected areas."}, {"id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.S7", "text": "In such cases, it needs to be clear that offset funding is not replacing other potential conservation investment or enabling cost-shifting by governments."}], "entities": [{"id": "896dc440181deb37e21efad4a58ad3065961aa73f07a480e8d8de9c843ffae55", "mention_id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.FAC1", "text": "World Heritage Sites", "label": "FAC"}, {"id": "0777bd6da1ea23478dec7b586908164f257de078df704b946abef3b69e807cf3", "mention_id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.LOC2", "text": "Ramsar Sites", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "ede5d718b141f2cbcc062312ffc13210a3a90b912029b4be3ec8b86bd3828834", "mention_id": "969301c354b2ea740137ab07745de7a7221bd35f570d9d6abce026f80cf5ea8a.PG160.PA11.ORG3", "text": "BirdLife Internationals", "label": "ORG"}]}

Shutdown was led by observers at up to five sites around the wind farm and two more vantage points within the wind farm; which was supported by a radar to detect and track birds at larger distances. Observers are present throughout the southward migration season, with the radar support only during the highest migratory period. In the first three years, shutdown orders were delivered from the observers to the control centre, who then shut down turbines.
