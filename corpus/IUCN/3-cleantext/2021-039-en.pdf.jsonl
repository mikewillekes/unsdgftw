Moreover, as more than half of the States Parties have no World Heritage properties in the HKH region inscribed under natural criteria, it is not even possible to speak of a trend in these cases. While no clear general trend over time is suggested here, it is interesting to note that almost one third (3) of all inscriptions of properties under natural criteria (10) occurred within less than one decade between 1979 and 1988 (note that the first World Heritage properties were inscribed in 1978). One can thus argue that regional interest peaked in the first decade of World Heritage inscriptions. There have since been only two inscriptions each in the 1990s and the 2000s, respectively. The 2010s have seen an increase to three properties, which could generously be interpreted as an indication of renewed interest. At the country level, Chinas first two inscriptions in the region occurred in 1992, two more in the 2000s and the most recent one in 2017. When including Manas and Kaziranga in the immediate vicinity of HKH, the data for India show two peaks, the first in the second half of the 1980s, when three of its five properties were inscribed. Ignoring the extension of Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks in 2005 for this purpose, the recent inscriptions of two properties in 2014 and 2016, respectively, constitute the second peak. Nepals two natural World Heritage properties were both inscribed in the first years since the establishment of the World Heritage List in 1978.", "sentences": [{"id":

When adding Kaziranga National Park and Manas, a small wildlife sanctuary at the time of inscription, a pattern of inscriptions of relatively small protected areas emerges. None of these protected areas had a formally defined buffer zone in line with contemporary World Heritage requirements and expectations at the time of inscription. These early inscriptions thereby reflect standard governmental and technical conservation thinking, law and practice at the time. It is remarkable and encouraging that an emergence of more complex approaches is observable over time, in line with the ideas synthesised in Box 2. This is summarised as follows:  The inscription of three very large properties since 2003 are strong and regionally unprecedented commitments to the Convention and its objectives.  Two of the above large-scale inscriptions are serial properties, namely, they are comprised of distinct protected areas linked under one coherent World Heritage approach. Prior to 2005, there was not a single serial property in the region.

The following overview starts with hints at the potential of contiguous and/or serial extensions of existing World Heritage properties, in no particular order, prior to listing hints at potential new sites.  Khangchendzonga National Park in India is routinely described as a conservation gem with intricate links to several other areas of global conservation importance. From a technical perspective, the most obvious extension candidate is the contiguous Kangchenjunga Conservation Area. There are many nearby protected areas of highest conservation importance in Bhutan, China, India and Nepal, as detailed in earlier chapters.  Sagarmatha National Park encompasses part of the worlds highest mountain, a partial coverage following political borders rather than a conservation rationale. From a technical perspective, there is obvious potential for a more meaningful World Heritage coverage of the peak of our planet.  The boundaries of several components of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas coincide with national and sub-national borders. While already a large and complex serial property, extensions into neighbouring Sichuan, TAR and/or Myanmar deserve analysis from a technical perspective.  The various properties in Chinas Sichuan Province are all embedded in much larger landscapes of highest conservation priority and could likely benefit from contiguous or serial extensions; the area may even enable new independent nominations. From a technical perspective, all options deserve further scrutiny.  Manas Wildlife Sanctuary is the existing property that is most often referenced in the reviewed literature as an integral part of a larger landscape of highest conservation significance. While just on the margin of HKH, the area depends on the HKH, with which it is ecologically, hydrologically and culturally linked. As detailed earlier, the property is today embedded within a large binational protected area complex. The contiguous Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan would appear to be an obvious sister park deserving further analysis, whereas an independent nomination would seem less promising due to the similarity and coherence with the existing property. The situation has even attracted the attention of the World Heritage Committee, which recommended the extension of the current property into neighbouring Bhutan, while also encouraging extension and consolidation on the Indian side of the border.  Chitwan National Park is part of a cluster of protected areas in Nepal and India in the Terai Lowlands sometimes described as the Terai Arc. As both some of the protected areas and the surrounding landscape are partially degraded and highly threatened, reconnecting the various protected areas is the most promising, if not the only, longterm option to maintain viable populations of wide-ranging species, including flagship species of the property, such as rhinos, elephants and tigers. Consequently, a more ambitious World Heritage approach is to be recommended if the property is to maintain its biodiversity values. Potential extensions would have to be further analysed with a focus on integrity.  Shey Phoksundo National Park and Upper Dolpo in Nepal are a rare case of strong local interest in developing a World Heritage nomination.
