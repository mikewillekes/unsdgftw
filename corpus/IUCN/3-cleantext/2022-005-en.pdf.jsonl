The aquaculture productions associate several species of carps and tilapia, feeding at various trophic levels in the ponds. The system is also associates pig farms, as the manure fertilizes the ponds and enhance the production of phytoplankton or macrophytes. Such agri-aquasystems can be clearly associated to agro-ecological methods.

For instance, in Catarina State in Brazil, the continental aquaculture system is based upon a polycultural farming system in earthen ponds, inspired by the Asian traditional systems. The aquaculture productions associate several species of carps and tilapia, feeding at various trophic levels in the ponds.

Aubin et al. explain that a direct reference to agro-ecology in aquaculture appears in different studies.

Custodio et al. highlight IMTA as endorsed by scientists as a more sustainable mode of aquaculture than intensive monocultures. In IMTA, nutrient effluents originating from artificially fed cultures, in both particulate and dissolved forms, are redirected to downstream trophic levels to nourish extractive species, thus mimicking the functioning of the natural ecosystem. Consequently, the IMTA system could be assimilated to an NbS based on a restored or managed ecosystem.
