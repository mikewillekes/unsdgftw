South Africa: South Africas National Protected Area Expansion Strategy identifies the key areas for conservation and protection in each of its provinces, covering 190,109 km.2 According to the strategy the number of Well Protected Ecosystems is anticipated to more than double while Not Protected Ecosystems will reduce by around 70% in the next 20 years. South African National Parks has also set a target of expanding the territory under its management by 21,500 hectares from 2015 to 2022. In 2019, the Tembe Elephant Park, a community-owned park managed by the provincial authority Ezemvelo Kwa Zulu Natal Wildlife Authority, announced their intention to expand by 26,000 hectares to provide space to elephants to breed, almost doubling the current size of the park. Additionally, 20 new Marine Protected Areas were gazetted in 2019 increasing the marine area protected around the countrys mainland territory from 0.4% to 5%.  Seychelles: In 2000, the President of the Republic of Seychelles made a commitment to declare 50% of Seychelles terrestrial area under biodiversity conservation by 2020. In 2013, the government announced its intention to proclaim 30% of the marine Exclusive Economic Zone, a further 40,000,000 ha, to be protected, of which 50% (Seychelles Marine Spatial Plan Initiative, 2019) will be managed as high biodiversity zones, restricting almost all human activities. This target was realised due to a debt-fornature swap (developed and finalised in 2016 by the Nature Conservancy), that allowed Seychelles to restructure a part of its national debt in exchange for protecting its waters. A Marine Spatial Planning process is currently underway and is expected to be finalised in 2020. As a part this commitment, two new Marine Protected Areas covering 210 000 km2 of biodiverse ocean waters were established in 2018.  Rwanda: In 2018, the Rwanda Development Board expanded Volcanoes National Park for the first time in three decades, through the donation of a 27.8-hectare property from the African Wildlife Foundation. While this amount of land may seem small compared to other parts of Africa, Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa, making this size significant. This expansion provides additional habitat for the expanding population of the endangered mountain gorilla.  Ethiopia: The Simien Mountain National Park in Ethiopia was expanded from the original size of 136 km2 to 412 km2 (Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority, 2015)more than doubling the size of the Park. This is a significant increase in a highly fragile and ecologically significant landscape. SMNP was included on the list of the World Heritage Sites in Danger in 2006. The expansion of the Park to provide habitat for endemic and threatened species was listed as one of the criteria for removal from the list. In 2017 the SMNP was removed from this list due to the expansion efforts by the Government of Ethiopia (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2017).  Comoros: The Government of Comoros developed a strategic expansion plan for protected areas from 2017  2021. The plan envisages the establishment of five new national parks and creation of the Protected Areas Managing Agency by 2021 (Directorate of Environment and Forestry, 2017).", "raw_text": "African Governments are also pledging further support for expansion of the PA estate. Examples include:  Uganda: Mary Goretti Kitutu, the then Ugandan State Minister for the Environment vowed that Uganda would be a conservation leader in Africa, committing to increase the area under protection to 30% by 2030 (NTV Uganda, 2019).  South Africa: South Africas National Protected Area Expansion Strategy identifies the key areas for conservation and protection in each of its provinces, covering 190,109 km.2 According to the strategy the number of Well Protected Ecosystems is anticipated to more than double while Not Protected Ecosystems will reduce by around 70% in the next 20 years (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2016). South African National Parks (SANParks) has also set a target of expanding the territory under its management by 21,500 hectares from 2015 to 2022 (SANParks, 2019). In 2019, the Tembe Elephant Park, a community-owned park managed by the provincial authority Ezemvelo Kwa Zulu Natal Wildlife Authority, announced their intention to expand by 26,000 hectares to provide space to elephants to breed, almost doubling the current size of the park (29,800 ha) (Hattingh, M. & Mdletshe, M., 2019). Additionally, 20 new Marine Protected Areas (MPA) were gazetted in 2019 increasing the marine area protected around the countrys mainland territory from 0.4% to 5% (Save Our Seas Foundation, 2019).  Seychelles: In 2000, the President of the Republic of Seychelles made a commitment to declare 50% of Seychelles terrestrial area under biodiversity conservation by 2020. In 2013, the government announced its intention to proclaim 30% of the marine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a further 40,000,000 ha (The Government of Seychelles, 2017), to be protected, of which 50% (Seychelles Marine Spatial Plan Initiative (SMSP), 2019) will be managed as high biodiversity zones, restricting almost all human activities. This target was realised due to a debt-fornature swap (developed and finalised in 2016 by the Nature Conservancy (TNC)), that allowed Seychelles to restructure a part of its national debt in exchange for protecting its waters. A Marine Spatial Planning process is currently underway and is expected to be finalised in 2020. As a part this commitment, two new Marine Protected Areas (waters surrounding the Aldabra archipelago, and the stretch of ocean between the Amirantes group of coral islands and Fortune Bank) covering 210 000 km2 of biodiverse ocean waters (size of Great Britain) were established in 2018 (TNC, 2019).  Rwanda: In 2018, the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) expanded Volcanoes National Park for the first time in three decades, through the donation of a 27.8-hectare property from the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) (RDB, 2018). While this amount of land may seem small compared to other parts of Africa, Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa (Sawe, B.E., 2017), making this size significant. This expansion provides additional habitat for the expanding population of the endangered mountain gorilla.  Ethiopia: The Simien Mountain National Park (SMNP) in Ethiopia was expanded from the original size of 136 km2 (in 1976) to 412 km2 (in 2007) (Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA), 2015)more than doubling the size of the Park.
