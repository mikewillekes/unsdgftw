The existing WHS covers the higher slopes of the mountain from an elevation of about 2,000-2,400m to the summit (1,824 km2), together with a separate component comprising the Ngare Ndare Forest Reserve and the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. This area (198 km2, at 2,200m to 1,700m) was added as a serial extension in 2013. The extension is (very tentatively) linked to the main block via a 9.8 km-long elephant corridor that runs through commercial farmland that separates the two component parts. A further extension would seek to consolidate this link by expanding the elephant corridor (through necessary land acquisition) and perhaps incorporate other areas at lower elevations (particularly the Imenti Forest and areas on the southeast slopes of the mountain).
