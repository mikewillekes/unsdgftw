The younger generations access to schooling and exposure to a wider world through television, social media and consumer and popular culture is shaping aspirations for another kind of life; girls are distancing themselves from the agriculture and forest work that still defines the lives of their elders. This generational gap casts new light on the diversity of experiences and growing complexities that characterise contemporary Pahadi households, as trajectories of change over the past few decades have altered physical, material and social landscapes. Peoples relationships to the land and natural resources are changing, as are their concerns and priorities; the young in particular seek new social roles, relationships and ways of being in the world. Our work highlights the urgency of developing more nuanced understandings of the embodiment of gender in mountain ecosystems that draw on these contemporary realities and, critically, acknowledge social and attitudinal realities as the young themselves perceive them. At a conceptual level, gender analysis based on cross-generational differences challenges the common perspective that views mountain women within a restrictive domestic economy and natural resource management approach while overlooking the heterogeneity of circumstances and experiences that shape their lives.

Today Uttarakhands villages are no longer entirely rural in the sense of the words normative association with an agrarian economy. Depending on location and accessibility as well as migration and employment histories, these villages are likely to be a melting pot of the old and the new. Changes are apparent in newly constructed houses with contemporary urban designs, the penetration of consumer goods, expanded mobility and so on. The most visible manifestations of generational change in the hill villages of Uttarakhand are revealed in the different preferences for clothing and foods as well as an explicit transition from the use of local dialects to Hindi as a common language. These shifts are apparent even within a single household, where it is common to see women at different life stages wearing different types of clothing, stating a preference for different types of foods, and observing different customs in their preparation of food. Preferences also differ regarding how open they are to eating outside the home or at community functions and their choice of language.

Thus, ecosystem resilience is the capacity of ecosystems to deal with disturbances, either by resisting them, recovering from them, or adapting to them.

Adaptation is generally defined as a systematic approach that integrates socio-economic and ecological systems in order to tackle the consequences of climate change (Gallopin, 2006; Smit et al., 1999). Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) in particular can be understood as the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall strategy to assist people in adapting to the adverse effects of climate change (CBD, 2009). EbA is based on an integrated approach that constitutes the range of conservation, restoration and sustainable ecosystem management practices that assist in building ecosystem resilience (Adhikari et al., 2018; Dixit et al., 2015). The IPCC (2001) report defines resilience as the ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-organisation and the capacity to adapt to stress and change. Thus, ecosystem resilience is the capacity of ecosystems to deal with disturbances, either by resisting them, recovering from them, or adapting to them. Resilient ecosystems can carry on delivering services and benefits despite disturbances. If they are not resilient, ecosystems are unable to function and deliver services and benefits (Natural Resources Wales, 2016).", "sentences": [{"id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.S0", "text": "Various adaptation studies have been conducted in the Panchase region."}, {"id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.S1", "text": "Adaptation is generally defined as a systematic approach that integrates socio-economic and ecological systems in order to tackle the consequences of climate change."}, {"id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.S2", "text": "Ecosystem-based Adaptation in particular can be understood as the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall strategy to assist people in adapting to the adverse effects of climate change."}, {"id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.S3", "text": "EbA is based on an integrated approach that constitutes the range of conservation, restoration and sustainable ecosystem management practices that assist in building ecosystem resilience."}, {"id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.S4", "text": "The IPCC report defines resilience as the ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-organisation and the capacity to adapt to stress and change."}, {"id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.S5", "text": "Thus, ecosystem resilience is the capacity of ecosystems to deal with disturbances, either by resisting them, recovering from them, or adapting to them."}, {"id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.S6", "text": "Resilient ecosystems can carry on delivering services and benefits despite disturbances."}, {"id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.S7", "text": "If they are not resilient, ecosystems are unable to function and deliver services and benefits."}], "entities": [{"id": "5a9d27b8a65ad003a5ab4fa17346dede8a10ac7e46257163cd3fba2578235ff0", "mention_id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.GPE0", "text": "Panchase", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "8c4a8da3409754e05935e9e39276fd420bbb64818705ac4cb1b1eb81712da3d2", "mention_id": "f1863dc845df9c9892dc689d1a36ad0601b4919eab625ba7556b905b739f2dc2.PG67.PA4.ORG1", "text": "IPCC", "label": "ORG"}]}

Until the early 1960s, crossborder socio-cultural exchange including marriages and trade helped local communities to flourish in an otherwise remote inaccessible mountainous landscape. The scenario changed somewhat after the Indo-China War in 1962 as borders were sealed and informal exchange was discouraged between the two countries.
