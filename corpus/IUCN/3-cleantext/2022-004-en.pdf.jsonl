This was necessary given the strong, mostly unsubstantiated narratives around wild animals and disease risks, whether in nature or under human management, subsistence use or exploitation. This was partly a concern because current evidence for COVID-19 as a zoonotic disease was primarily circumstantial, and while epidemiologists broadly agree on what constitutes a zoonosis, direct evidence is not always available to confirm its emergence pathway when suspected, as in this case. Although increased monitoring of human-mediated movement of wildlife around the world remains an important goal for conservation and public health, a better understanding of the role of domesticated animals and wildlife under direct domestic management as a reservoir and source of zoonosis and novel pathogens is possibly a higher priority. For example, the extensive Global Burden of Disease1, work done collaboratively by the Harvard School of Public Health, the World Health Organization and the World Bank do not always differentiate zoonoses from other sources of infection, making any analysis of the role of zoonotic modes of transmission in human infection risk and the impact of zoonotic disease on human health almost impossible. The initial reaction of many actors in the global conservation community to COVID-19 to call for a ban on all wildlife trade was understandable, as it was perhaps successful to some extent in limiting the sale of certain wildlife for food in markets, whilst including provisions on wildlife ownership, protection and management mechanisms, and penalties for law violations. However, examination of the scientific evidence does not support the assertion that this measure would have a substantial impact on preventing future epidemics or that it has averted any of the current risks. This does not mean improved sanitary measures applied to wildlife trade are not important, quite the reverse, it is a serious gap in veterinary regulation that it is not done in many instances or is not effective. Perhaps the most important lesson of this situation analysis is that nature continues to be a critical ally to our well-being.

AMR is accelerated by the inappropriate or excessive use of natural and synthesised antimicrobial agents. Emerging infectious diseases derived from an antimicrobial resistance organism with a wildlife origin are extremely rare, but as the genes determining resistance emerge from human, domesticated animal sources under antimicrobial use, or naturally; they inevitably find their way into the environment and can be tracked to wildlife species and ecosystems. There is potential for spillback (i.e. backward transmission from a new host back to the original host) but as yet very little evidence of this being an issue. However, wildlife species are not treated with antimicrobials (unless under human care or unintentionally through indirect pathways) so there is no likely immediate feedback or consequence to humans or domesticated animal industry. Antimicrobial resistance is a primary concern for human and animal health throughout the world. Impacts of antimicrobial resistance in free ranging wildlife appear minimal, but exists as recent MRSA evidence in European hedgehogs as a source of MRSA in dairy cattle shows.

Recently this effect has been elegantly shown for Monkey Fever in India, where forest fragmentation and edge effects are critical to its emergence and where cattle are co-risk factors as tick vector abundance is promoted by the cattle. The majority of zoonoses are more usually in peridomestic environments, where certain wildlife, especially rodents, have adapted to human landscapes and become abundant, examples are plague 1-2,000 cases per year and Lassa fever <500,000 cases per year. Quite fundamental to the epidemiology of new pathogens, wherever they arise, is that human populations are on the increase along with their domesticated animals, which is why the forest is fragmented and the landscape changes.

Recently this effect has been elegantly shown for Monkey Fever in India, where forest fragmentation and edge effects are critical to its emergence and where cattle are co-risk factors as tick vector abundance is promoted by the cattle (Walsh et al., 2019). The majority of zoonoses are more usually in peridomestic environments (Albery et al., 2021), where certain wildlife, especially rodents, have adapted to human landscapes and become abundant, examples are plague (Yersinia pestis) 1-2,000 cases per year and Lassa fever (Lassa mammarenavirus) <500,000 cases per year (Asogun et al., 2019).

Despite this, capacity to detect potential zoonotic pathogens in large shipments is limited. The detection of ill and/or infected animals is largely dependent of the countries investment on biosecurity practices and would only be likely to occur when an animal shows signs of sickness, was dead on arrival, or required quarantine; unless there are active surveillance measures in place.

Every port of entry to countries has an animal and plant inspection service focused mainly on disease, collecting data, and interrogating where any anomalies in permitting exist. Despite this, capacity to detect potential zoonotic pathogens in large shipments is limited. The detection of ill and/or infected animals is largely dependent of the countries investment on biosecurity practices and would only be likely to occur when an animal shows signs of sickness, was dead on arrival, or required quarantine; unless there are active surveillance measures in place (e.g. in accordance to the vaccination status and/or country of origin).
