In Africa, these lost opportunities have compounded impacts on communities when they are displaced, forced off land and subsequently lose their source of food and income (Dancer & Tsikata, 2015). In Indonesia, a number of case studies examining the gendered impacts of palm plantations have demonstrated that the adverse outcomes for women and whole communities can result in increased domestic violence. Women who have experienced a loss in income and land once used for vegetable and rice farming also experience the deterioration of their status as landholders, which increases their vulnerability to acts of violence in the plantation workforce and increased domestic violence associated with increased alcohol consumption from mens palm oil plantation incomes (Li, 2015).", "sentences": [{"id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG141.PA6.S1", "text": "In Africa, these lost opportunities have compounded impacts on communities when they are displaced, forced off land and subsequently lose their source of food and income."}, {"id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG141.PA6.S2", "text": "In Indonesia, a number of case studies examining the gendered impacts of palm plantations have demonstrated that the adverse outcomes for women and whole communities can result in increased domestic violence."}, {"id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG141.PA6.S3", "text": "Women who have experienced a loss in income and land once used for vegetable and rice farming also experience the deterioration of their status as landholders, which increases their vulnerability to acts of violence in the plantation workforce and increased domestic violence associated with increased alcohol consumption from mens palm oil plantation incomes."}], "entities": [{"id": "00a9e4255a5b63067b76cbfb9fd67f26bdb91be802d5ffcb177ec1b7a8d4c623", "mention_id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG141.PA6.PERSON0", "text": "Li", "label": "PERSON"}, {"id": "3f5053b3ae70794bff96eb3501a85eedda4b3ee740c9207e6568df248a867c13", "mention_id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG141.PA6.LOC2", "text": "Africa", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "341cf9022a3e6469098ed7a7d056071f73087d283407c3b108c6e0fd8996ef3c", "mention_id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG141.PA6.GPE3", "text": "Indonesia", "label": "GPE"}]}

A case from Southeast Asia reported that in response to changes in economic opportunities, a young woman was coerced into sex-related work in communities near a protected area outpost, but despite attempts by the project staff to report the abuse to authorities and engage with a civil society group to support the victim, the incident was ultimately forgotten, since it was seen as beyond the scope of the nature conservation project in question (GBV-ENV survey respondent EN64).", "sentences": [{"id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG218.PA6.S1", "text": "Without doing so, environmental interventions, such as the creation and management of protected areas, can have negative unintended impacts on the livelihoods, economies and social dynamics of local communities, and can lead to negative consequences for women and girls."}, {"id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG218.PA6.S2", "text": "For instance, establishment of some types of protected areas can result in restrictions on resource and land use that can negatively affect local gender dynamics and socio-economic conditions."}, {"id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG218.PA6.S3", "text": "In Mkomazi Game Reserve in Tanzania, the removal of tens of thousands of livestock led to more intra-household conflicts, as men tried to appropriate womens income in the face of greater scarcity."}, {"id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG218.PA6.S4", "text": "A case from Southeast Asia reported that in response to changes in economic opportunities, a young woman was coerced into sex-related work in communities near a protected area outpost, but despite attempts by the project staff to report the abuse to authorities and engage with a civil society group to support the victim, the incident was ultimately forgotten, since it was seen as beyond the scope of the nature conservation project in question."}], "entities": [{"id": "ac5ea0b33663a9002045ebb4aa117053aaf4fb62290fc6b6e6ba640a2745a2c2", "mention_id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG218.PA6.LAW0", "text": "Chapter 8).", "label": "LAW"}, {"id": "8d0a03607805de6c90baed1faa91b08ef74f334ea003a997874b1250c3246080", "mention_id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG218.PA6.FAC1", "text": "Mkomazi Game Reserve", "label": "FAC"}, {"id": "74947702044149ef93770757be7871d8aaadc966338e735d6cc21ac8609c9b77", "mention_id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG218.PA6.GPE2", "text": "Tanzania", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "6eadfec44e00a2091a4254790b5609e02bfb4ad2fd6818921c3c7ba351a57424", "mention_id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG218.PA6.LOC4", "text": "Southeast Asia", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "de9feaea8b66f7ba74845ee5fc156cdd22e8e4533de13ca76d71ac495da358ff", "mention_id": "26923182d2f387280a2c9cf3586945aa04c29d1a3172e4490298f8225b2fce77.PG218.PA6.PHRASE0", "text": "gender", "label": "PHRASE"}]}
