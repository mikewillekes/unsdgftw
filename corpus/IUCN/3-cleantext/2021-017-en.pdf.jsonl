Reinforcement  is the intentional movement and release of an organism(s) into an existing population of conspecifics, and is synonymous with the terms augmentation, supplementation, and restocking. Reinforcement may be done for several reasons, including to enhance population viability, increase genetic diversity, or increase the representation of specific demographic groups or stages. ii. Reintroduction  is the intentional movement and release of an organism(s) inside the species indigenous range from which the species has disappeared. b. Conservation introduction  is the movement of an organism, by human agency, outside its species natural range to achieve a conservation goal. Non-conservation introductions may be performed for a variety of reasons, but are not the focus of this document. Conservation introductions comprise two activities: i.

The following describe more specific types of translocation. a. Population restoration  is a conservation translocation within the species historic, indigenous range and comprises two activities: i. Reinforcement  is the intentional movement and release of an organism(s) into an existing population of conspecifics, and is synonymous with the terms augmentation, supplementation, and restocking. Reinforcement may be done for several reasons, including to enhance population viability, increase genetic diversity, or increase the representation of specific demographic groups or stages. ii. Reintroduction  is the intentional movement and release of an organism(s) inside the species indigenous range from which the species has disappeared. b. Conservation introduction  is the movement of an organism, by human agency, outside its species natural range (past or present) to achieve a conservation goal. Non-conservation introductions may be performed for a variety of reasons, but are not the focus of this document (e.g. pest control, aesthetics, or religious purposes). Conservation introductions comprise two activities: i. Assisted colonisation  is the intentional movement and release of an organism outside its indigenous range to avoid extirpation of populations or extinction of the focal species. Assisted colonisation is primarily carried out where protection from current or likely future threats in the current range is deemed less feasible than at alternative sites outside the current range.", "sentences": [{"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG14.PA3.S0", "text": "Translocation  is the movement of an organism by human agency that is then released in a different area."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG14.PA3.S1", "text": "Translocation is the most general and highest-order term referring to human-mediated movement of a species, subspecies, or lower taxon."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG14.PA3.S2", "text": "Conservation translocations are defined as the intentional movement and release of a living organism where the primary objective is for conservation purposes."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG14.PA3.S3", "text": "These translocations usually attempt to improve the conservation status of the focal species locally or globally, and/or to restore natural ecosystem functions and processes."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG14.PA3.S4", "text": "The following describe more specific types of translocation."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG14.PA3.S5", "text": "a.

Typically, species should not be moved beyond their naturally occupied bioregions or areas connected by continuous habitat that are appropriate for the focal species.  In addition to issues associated with disease, assisted colonisation programmes must consider hybridisation with other species, competition, and predation, or other forms of disruption to the host environment.

High mortality rates of released individuals may be difficult to avoid because of the poorly studied nature of some amphibian species. For example, the optimal habitat or time of year to release individuals may not be known, and may require experimental releases of small groups of animals to examine survival and success.  If low survival occurs, utilising adaptive management policies to continuously try to improve release survival should improve translocation welfare.", "sentences": [{"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S0", "text": "Animal welfare of amphibians in translocations  "}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S1", "text": "Animal welfare is a goal for any translocation project, and conservation practitioners must comply with regulations concerning research and welfare of amphibians."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S2", "text": " Stress associated with translocation should not be underestimated and may occur at multiple stages of a wildlife translocation."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S3", "text": "Consequently, amphibian translocations should consider animal welfare issues and supportive management actions during all stages of the translocation process."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S4", "text": "Harrington et al. developed a decision tree to help identify relevant animal welfare considerations throughout the translocation process."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S5", "text": " Many amphibian translocations include captive breeding as a component and may involve animals kept in captivity for generations; thus, welfare considerations should play a prominent role in both planning and decision-making."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S6", "text": "Amphibians can experience acute pain and distress, and it is the responsibility of all parties working with amphibians to treat them as well as possible."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S7", "text": " Poor animal welfare in an amphibian translocation may cause increased stress and may be directly linked to problems that may impact the outcome of a conservation translocation."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S8", "text": "Also negative perceptions and loss of support from stakeholders or the public may result from inadequate attention to animal welfare."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S9", "text": " Ideally, once a captive amphibian is returned to the wild, the animal should experience what a wild conspecific would in a healthy, self-sustaining population."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S10", "text": "Released amphibians should be free to express normal behaviour in suitable habitat."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S11", "text": "It may be important for released populations to experience typical natural selection processes to ensure subsequent generations are adapted appropriately."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S12", "text": " Practitioners should use their best judgement so released animals have the greatest chance for success."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S13", "text": "For example, knowingly releasing animals into exceedingly poor habitat or areas with extremely low chances of survival would be irresponsible."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S14", "text": "Likewise, releasing individuals that have fared poorly in captivity can hinder the success of a release programme."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S15", "text": " High mortality rates of released individuals may be difficult to avoid because of the poorly studied nature of some amphibian species."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S16", "text": "For example, the optimal habitat or time of year to release individuals may not be known, and may require experimental releases of small groups of animals to examine survival and success."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.S17", "text": " If low survival occurs, utilising adaptive management policies to continuously try to improve release survival should improve translocation welfare."}], "entities": [{"id": "7cb0877aa1463df62b8775ebd3d60aa0a4f75bdac6fc7deaaca6dd52aab914a7", "mention_id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG41.PA2.PERSON0", "text": "Harrington", "label": "PERSON"}]}

This was supplemented by a further 12 individuals in 1987 and the species was bred for the first time in 1988. Further breeding colonies were subsequently established at other collection-based institutions and Universities in Europe, with the Balearic Island government retaining formal ownership of all animals. Following an assessment of potential re -introduction sites by the Mallorcan conservation authority, 76 tadpoles were returned to Mallorca and released at 2 sites in 1989. Since that time releases of both toadlets and tadpoles occurred on an annual basis up to 1997, and then less regularly until 2001. Meetings of all project partners have occurred at approximately two-yearly intervals to evaluate progress and decide upon future goals. In 1996 an extensive health screening program of captive toads was established. Toads underwent parasitological and bacterial screening for three months prior to release, and fecal samples were collected from both captive and wild toads for analysis by the veterinary department at Jersey Zoo. As all toads in captivity were descended from the original 20 founders collected in 1985 1987, and three new bloodlines were established in captivity in 1997 with the collection of 25 tadpoles from each of three wild populations. With concerns growing towards the end of the 1990s about the global impact of emerging infectious diseases on amphibians, a recommendation was made that no further re-introductions should be carried out until i) the disease implications of further re-introductions became clearer; and ii) genetic analysis of both wild and captive populations was carried out. Microsatellite DNA analysis was completed in 2006, and revealed that although populations in different gorges were largely isolated, wild populations retained relatively high levels of genetic diversity.

Screening for chytridiomycosis", "raw_text": "Project Summary A captive breeding program was initiated at Jersey Zoo in 1985 following the collection of 8 animals from the wild. This was supplemented by a further 12 individuals in 1987 and the species was bred for the first time in 1988. Further breeding colonies were subsequently established at other collection-based institutions and Universities in Europe, with the Balearic Island government retaining formal ownership of all animals. Following an assessment of potential re -introduction sites by the Mallorcan conservation authority (Conselleria dAgricultura i Pesca), 76 tadpoles were returned to Mallorca and released at 2 sites in 1989. Since that time releases of both toadlets and tadpoles occurred on an annual basis up to 1997 (Buley & Garcia, 1997), and then less regularly until 2001. Meetings of all project partners have occurred at approximately two-yearly intervals to evaluate progress and decide upon future goals. In 1996 an extensive health screening program of captive toads was established (probably the first for any amphibian in a captive-breeding program). Toads underwent parasitological and bacterial screening for three months prior to release, and fecal samples were collected from both captive and wild toads for analysis by the veterinary department at Jersey Zoo. As all toads in captivity were descended from the original 20 founders collected in 1985 1987, and three new bloodlines were established in captivity in 1997 with the collection of 25 tadpoles from each of three wild populations (Buley & Gonzalez-Villavicencio, 2000; Roca et al., 1998, 2000).

Box 733, Queanbeyan, NSW, 2620, Australia. Introduction The Booroolong frog is a medium-sized hylid frog, mostly restricted to the western flowing streams of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales and north-eastern Victoria, Australia.

During the summer of 2006-2007, drought threatened to cause the local extinction of Booroolong frogs in the Maragle Creek catchment as a result of stream drying. This was particularly concerning as the Booroolong frog was a flagship for riparian restoration on private properties along Maragle Creek. To prevent the local extinction of this population, a small founder population was collected to initiate a captive breeding program. Goals x Goal 1: Ensure the persistence of the Booroolong frog in the Maragle Creek catchment on the South Western Slopes of NSW, Australia. x Goal 2: Establish a captive insurance population and develop successful husbandry and breeding protocols for this species. x Goal 3: Conduct a trial release of captive-bred animals and closely monitor survival to maturity and breeding from these individuals in the wild. x Goal 4: Increase public awareness for the Booroolong frog, its declining population status and its habitat requirements in the local community. Success Indicators x Indicator 1: To establish successful captive breeding protocols x Indicator 2: That released animals survive to maturity and breed in the wild. x Indicator 3: To increase the awareness of the Booroolong frog in the local community. Project Summary Feasibility: Intensive surveys were undertaken for the presence of the Booroolong frog on the South West Slopes region of NSW during 2006. These surveys indicated that a number of populations were under threat of local extinction due to stream drying, including those in the Maragle Creek catchment. This was largely due to the modified, agricultural land-use and prolonged drought. Due to the short lifespan of this species and its reliance on streams for breeding, it is especially susceptible to reduced water flows. After two years of minimal rainfall, it was determined that the risk of losing this population was sufficiently high to warrant the collection of a small insurance population and initiate a captive breeding program. This would allow the release of captive bred individuals to supplement the depleted wild population should water flows increase, and provide an opportunity to assess the capacity to utilize re-introduction as a conservation tool for this species. Implementation: In February 2007, a founder population of 32 juvenile frogs was collected by staff of the NSW Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water and Taronga Zoo from three separate sites along Maragle Creek. An additional nine frogs were collected to conduct an initial disease screening to establish parasite and pathogen levels in the wild population. The frogs were transported to Taronga Zoo and held in a biosecure room and maintained under strict quarantine conditions.

Project Summary Feasibility: A Population Viability Analysis conducted by Hatfield et al. determined the Houston toad would likely go extinct within a decade if juvenile survivorship was below 1% and there was only one subpopulation. Field data suggested juvenile survivorship was 0.03%, much lower than originally assumed, and that there might indeed be only one viable subpopulation. A subsequent model-based estimate concluded juvenile survivorship to be 0.75% 1.5%, but again it appears that only one robust subpopulation exists. Thus, it was proposed by one of the authors to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service that without active stewardship the Houston toad would be extinct in the near future. We believe future recovery efforts should address pertinent biological weaknesses identified by the PVA, and focus on head-starting, habitat restoration, and creation of a captive assurance colony. This would not be the first time Houston toads were collected for ex situ conservation purposes. In the 1980s nearly 500,000 eggs, tadpoles, toadlets and adult Houston toads were captive propagated and translocated to the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge in the hopes of creating a second population in a protected area. This previous Houston toad ex situ conservation program provided relevant experience and information for the current work.

Project Summary Feasibility: A Population Viability Analysis (PVA) conducted by Hatfield et al. (2004) determined the Houston toad would likely go extinct within a decade if juvenile survivorship was below 1% and there was only one subpopulation. Field data suggested juvenile survivorship was 0.03% (Grueter, 2004), much lower than originally assumed, and that there might indeed be only one viable subpopulation. A subsequent model-based estimate concluded juvenile survivorship to be 0.75% 1.5% (Swannack et al., 2009), but again it appears that only one robust subpopulation exists. Thus, it was proposed by one of the authors to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service that without active stewardship the Houston toad would be extinct in the near future. We believe future recovery efforts should address pertinent biological weaknesses identified by the PVA, and focus on head-starting (to improve juvenile survivorship), habitat restoration (to increase the viability of additional subpopulations), and creation of a captive assurance colony. This would not be the first time Houston toads were collected for ex situ conservation purposes. In the 1980s nearly 500,000 eggs, tadpoles, toadlets and adult Houston toads were captive propagated and translocated to the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge in the hopes of creating a second population in a protected area. This previous Houston toad ex situ conservation program provided relevant experience and information for the current work.

Camino del Bosque, Silver City, NM 88061, USA atelles@fs.fed.us Introduction Chiricahua leopard frogs inhabit a diversity of aquatic habitats at elevations between 1,000 and 2,710 m in Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico. The species requires permanent or semi-permanent pools and may be excluded where Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis or introduced predators are present. Additional threats include predation by non-natives, drought, floods, habitat degradation and loss, disruption of metapopulation dynamics, demographic effects of small populations in dynamic environments, and pollutants. Lithobates chiricahuensis is listed as threatened in the USA under the Endangered Species Act and vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Camino del Bosque, Silver City, NM 88061, USA atelles@fs.fed.us Introduction Chiricahua leopard frogs (Lithobates [Rana] chiricahuensis) inhabit a diversity of aquatic habitats at elevations between 1,000 and 2,710 m in Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico (Sredl & Jennings, 2005). The species requires permanent or semi-permanent pools and may be excluded where Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) or introduced predators are present. Additional threats include predation by non-natives, drought, floods, habitat degradation and loss, disruption of metapopulation dynamics, demographic effects of small populations in dynamic environments, and pollutants (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2007). Lithobates chiricahuensis is listed as threatened in the USA under the Endangered Species Act (67 FR 40790) and vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Santos-Barrera et al., 2004).

Three of which were recipients of 312 egg masses produced in the wild by released frogs.

Case Study 2 Pajarita Wilderness and Alamo-Pena Blanca-Peck Canyon MAs, Arizona, USA and Mexico: The Pajarita Wilderness and Alamo-Pena Blanca-Peck Canyon MAs are located in extreme southern Arizona and adjacent Mexico. In the 1930s, the Atascosa-Pajarito mountains supported three native ranid frogs: L. chiricahuensis, lowland leopard frog, and Tarahumara frog. By the late-1970s, populations of L. chiricahuensis and L. yavapaiensis dramatically declined and L. tarahumarae was extirpated, likely due in part to chytridiomycosis. In addition, over the last few decades, L. chiricahuensis and L. yavapaiensis have slowly been displaced by invasive, introduced bullfrogs. In fall 2008, efforts to eradicate L. catesbeianus were initiated. By 2010, post-removal monitoring confirmed that L. catesbeianus had been eradicated. Monitoring indicated immediate changes to L. chiricahuensis and L. yavapaiensis distributions. Surveys from 2010 2011, revealed L. chiricahuensis and L. yavapaiensis had dispersed into eight and three sites, respectively, that were previously unsuitable due to presence of L. catesbeianus. Lithobates chiricahuensis dispersed overland and through ephemeral drainages at least 7.9 km, occupying a site farther north than the species has recently been documented in the region. The results of this project indicate that re-introduction of native amphibians is not always necessary if a key threat is removed. Although Bd is still present throughout the mountain range, populations of native frogs are now persisting with the disease, and elimination of bullfrogs has created a landscape where both L. chiricahuensis and L. yavapaiensis can potentially thrive with minimal management.

Data on the former distribution of this species are rather incomplete. Several faunists of German origin have mentioned the species as being present in Latvia in the 18th 19th centuries. Several reports have even been received in the 1980s. Intensive agriculture, rapid deterioration in total area covered mainly by wetlands, and extinction of beaver in Latvia in the end of 19th century, could be the main factors, which could cause the vanishing of Hyla arborea from Latvia.

Monitoring is conducted using a shout-response technique that has a high confidence of detecting mature calling males. The number of mature females is estimated based on the number of clutches within male nests. Due to their cryptic nature, there are no techniques to monitor immature individuals. Surveys in March 2014 detected 7 males at each of the two release sites, though no eggs were laid in any of their nests. Due to the low number of adults at release sites between 2009 and 2011, and the lack of detection of frogs since 2011, it is suspected that these individuals were likely from the first tadpole releases in 2010. This is supported by length of time to maturity, with males typically maturing at 3 years in the wild, whilst females mature at 4 years. Thus in 2014, males from the 2010 tadpole release would be mature at just over 3 years of age, whilst the females may not, resulting in the perceived sexual bias. In March 2015, seven males were detected at one site, whilst 13 were detected at the second site. At the end of the breeding season, the nests were inspected to identify and photograph males and assess their size.

The ultimate goal of the captive-breeding program was to provide stock and increase the species population size across different breeding streams to ensure their long-term survival and release of captive-raised YSMN to their habitat. In establishing the captive-breeding facility and performing the subsequent trial reintroduction, individuals from different breeding streams were kept separate in order to avoid genetic interaction. The reintroduction site identified by application of a multicriteria decision analysis in a GIS format. Implementation: The captive-breeding facility for reintroduction of YSMN began with allocating a 5 m long  2.5 m wide  3 m high room at Razi University. Additional space was available for eggs and larvae. The CBF was ventilated by an air-conditioner that recirculated the indoor air and each aquarium included terrestrial habitat in the form of small pebbles collected from the wild. The aquaria contained some aquatic plants for egg attachments and hiding opportunities. The suitability of different potential reintroduction sites was assessed against several criteria, i.e. degree of isolation from human settlements, proximity to a benthic macroinvertebrate community, submerged vegetation cover, water temperature, altitude, and land use along the stream. We examined the morphology of springs and streams, as well as their vegetative composition and structure. Among five sites investigated, the Mivan Spring was selected for a trial reintroduction of YSMN. This spring immediately joins Mivan Stream, which contains a well developed submerged periphyton vegetation. Along the stream there are also well-established emergent and marginal plant communities.

In establishing the captive-breeding facility and performing the subsequent trial reintroduction, individuals from different breeding streams were kept separate in order to avoid genetic interaction. The reintroduction site identified by application of a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) in a GIS format. Implementation: The captive-breeding facility for reintroduction of YSMN began with allocating a 5 m long  2.5 m wide  3 m high room at Razi University. Additional space was available for eggs and larvae. The CBF was ventilated by an air-conditioner that recirculated the indoor air and each aquarium included terrestrial habitat in the form of small pebbles collected from the wild. The aquaria contained some aquatic plants for egg attachments and hiding opportunities. The suitability of different potential reintroduction sites was assessed against several criteria, i.e. degree of isolation from human settlements, proximity to a benthic macroinvertebrate community, submerged vegetation cover, water temperature, altitude, and land use along the stream. We examined the morphology of springs and streams, as well as their vegetative composition and structure. Among five sites investigated, the Mivan Spring was selected for a trial reintroduction of YSMN (Sharifi & Vaissi, 2014). This spring immediately joins Mivan Stream, which contains a well developed submerged periphyton vegetation. Along the stream there are also well-established emergent and marginal plant communities. For the reintroduction, the largest individuals of similar age (5 7 mm) newts were", "sentences": [{"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG170.PA1.S0", "text": "54 x

Success indicators x Indicator 1: Radio transmitters would work normally for at least one year, enabling data collection on the salamanders reintroduction. x Indicator 2: More than 50% of released individuals survived the first year and experienced growth similar to conspecifics. x Indicator 3: Animals that survived had a period of settlement and chose habitat similar to wild animals. x Indicator 4: Salamanders established territory and followed seasonal movement patterns similar to wild animals. x Indicator 5: Increased local awareness of giant salamander conservation, such that no poaching happened during the reintroduction study.

It may also be possible that chytrid is prevalent in the environment and spread via other means (e.g. other wildlife).", "sentences": [{"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG199.PA1.S2", "text": "Since then, frogs have tested negative."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG199.PA1.S3", "text": "A frog infected with chytrid fungus can develop the disease chytridiomycosis, although the relationship between immunity and the presence of Chytrid fungus in L. archeyi is currently unclear."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG199.PA1.S4", "text": "Given that all the frogs released in both translocations had tested negative for chytrid three times before release, the finding of chytrid in the translocated population demonstrates the difficulty in maintaining any wild frog population as chytrid free despite quarantine protocols."}, {"id": "0e203a81bb59e7f8c8d6f45bc13f148052da9eb46b83a2a5b466f2140d92283b.PG199.PA1.S5", "text": "It may also be possible that chytrid is prevalent in the environment and spread via other means."}], "entities": []}
