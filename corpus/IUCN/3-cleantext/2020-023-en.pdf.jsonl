It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide.

For example, at least 27 species of insects have been described as resistant to Bacillus thuringiensis toxins. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that biopesticides can have similar impacts as synthetic pesticides on soil biodiversity, especially when used at doses recommended for agriculture (Romdhane et al., 2019, Shao et al. 2017). Other commonly used biopesticides include entomopathogenic nematodes such as Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae that have been used effectively against insects (Lacey & Georgis, 2012), as well as species of the fungus Trichoderma that are used against soil-borne plant pathogenic fungi and also produce a variety of compounds that promote plant growth (Verma et al., 2007). By reducing the populations of pests in agriculture, biological control services reduce the need for chemical pesticides (Power, 2010). Some studies suggest that insect predators and parasitoids account for approximately 33% of natural pest control (Hawkins et al., 1999), and the value of pest control services attributed to insects has been estimated at US$ 4.5 billion annually in the United States alone (Losey & Vaughan, 2006).", "sentences": [{"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG37.PA4.S0", "text": "In a more recent review, Siegwart showed that all widely used biopesticides ultimately select resistant individuals."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG37.PA4.S1", "text": "For example, at least 27 species of insects have been described as resistant to Bacillus thuringiensis toxins."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG37.PA4.S2", "text": "Similarly, it has been demonstrated that biopesticides can have similar impacts as synthetic pesticides on soil biodiversity, especially when used at doses recommended for agriculture."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG37.PA4.S3", "text": "Other commonly used biopesticides include entomopathogenic nematodes such as Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae that have been used effectively against insects, as well as species of the fungus Trichoderma that are used against soil-borne plant pathogenic fungi and also produce a variety of compounds that promote plant growth."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG37.PA4.S4", "text": "By reducing the populations of pests in agriculture, biological control services reduce the need for chemical pesticides."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG37.PA4.S5", "text": "Some studies suggest that insect predators and parasitoids account for approximately 33% of natural pest control, and the value of pest control services attributed to insects has been estimated at US$ 4.5 billion annually in the United States alone."}], "entities": [{"id": "780c1949cafd836b0a5746e12cdcb204242fe7b8e318e010c65fe60545d076e7", "mention_id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG37.PA4.ORG0", "text": "Siegwart", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "981e5b396726008318fcca73b116e69d1680fdbe17a7fb078d10197731f1e700", "mention_id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG37.PA4.GPE5", "text": "the United States", "label": "GPE"}]}

However, the relationship between soil erosion and soil biodiversity is complex (Orgiazzi & Panagos, 2018). The burrowing activity of earthworms or the dense networks of mycorrhizal fungi can reduce the amount of soil eroded by rain or windstorms by keeping soil aggregates more compacted (Burri et al., 2013; Shuster et al., 2002). However, cast production by some earthworm species can also accelerate erosion processes, since cast material could be easily moved away by water (Shipitalo & Protz, 1987).", "sentences": [{"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG50.PA4.S0", "text": "Physical soil erosion typically occurs when soil is left exposed to rain or wind energy."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG50.PA4.S1", "text": "Soil erosion leads to reduced productivity or, in extreme cases, to the abandonment of the land."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG50.PA4.S2", "text": "Studies clearly show that soil erosion negatively affects soil biodiversity."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG50.PA4.S3", "text": "However, the relationship between soil erosion and soil biodiversity is complex."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG50.PA4.S4", "text": "The burrowing activity of earthworms or the dense networks of mycorrhizal fungi can reduce the amount of soil eroded by rain or windstorms by keeping soil aggregates more compacted."}, {"id": "8c21792ea1ef89037382a959984a8d0d042ca4b54de44816e2ad3c1c82020f4b.PG50.PA4.S5", "text": "However, cast production by some earthworm species can also accelerate erosion processes, since cast material could be easily moved away by water."}], "entities": []}
