Developing a more granular set of data to allow for the methodology to become more actionable, for example by capturing the influence of different textile fibres, knitting techniques, or washing parameters, in the case of textiles. In the case of mismanaged waste, it will be essential to refine our understanding of the leakage pathways, considering different waste characteristics as well as local parameters. Increasing the granularity of the data and improving the understanding of the leakage pathway are key in order to use the Marine Plastic Footprint methodology to guide eco-design projects.  There may be a need to refine the two percent littering rate adopted by Jambeck et al., which, in some cases, can be overestimated. A case-by-case, country-specific estimation would greatly help calculations used for estimating local and global Marine Plastic Footprints.  The methodology allows the user to integrate the degradation rates of different plastics. However, there is no reliable method to measure these degradation times in the marine environment. Therefore, this issue should be resolved, to harness the development of the Marine Plastic Footprint methodology.  What about plastic neutrality and offsetting? An emerging offsetting scheme concerning plastic is emerging, but it is still applied at a rather small scale. The plastic methodology could be used to scale-up and monitor plastic offsetting projects. This should be investigated further in the future.  These top-down approaches would benefit from a level of validation in the field, to compare the modelled predictions with the reality. Riverine systems, known to be vectors of plastic pollution, would be ideal sampling environments to calibrate modelled predictions.  There is now sufficient evidence to say that plastic pollution is ubiquitous in the marine environment. Allocating resources to shift towards a more circular economy would be greatly beneficial, as would adopting measures to reduce the usage of single-use plastics.  Integrating an impact assessment aspect in the future would expand and strengthen this footprinting methodology. However, this aspect still requires years of research to understand the full scale of threats presented by plastic pollution. Linking this impact assessment to ecosystem services could create a tool to evaluate the damages to both wildlife and human well-being, to help reduce negative impacts on the environment.", "raw_text": "The following areas of focus for future improvements to the methodology are suggested:  Building a consensus with industries (mainly the tyre/automotive industry and the textile industry) on calculation rules and loss rates, as well as generic data to be used for calculations.

In the case of mismanaged waste, it will be essential to refine our understanding of the leakage pathways, considering different waste characteristics as well as local parameters (e.g., wind, slope, urban infrastructure, etc.). Increasing the granularity of the data and improving the understanding of the leakage pathway are key in order to use the Marine Plastic Footprint methodology to guide eco-design projects.  There may be a need to refine the two percent littering rate adopted by Jambeck et al. (2015), which, in some cases, can be overestimated. A case-by-case, country-specific estimation would greatly help calculations used for estimating local and global Marine Plastic Footprints.  The methodology allows the user to integrate the degradation rates of different plastics. However, there is no reliable method to measure these degradation times in the marine environment. Therefore, this issue should be resolved, to harness the development of the Marine Plastic Footprint methodology.  What about plastic neutrality and offsetting? An emerging offsetting scheme concerning plastic is emerging, but it is still applied at a rather small scale. The plastic methodology could be used to scale-up and monitor plastic offsetting projects. This should be investigated further in the future.  These top-down approaches would benefit from a level of validation in the field, to compare the modelled predictions with the reality (bottom-up approach). Riverine systems, known to be vectors of plastic pollution, would be ideal sampling environments to calibrate modelled predictions.  There is now sufficient evidence to say that plastic pollution is ubiquitous in the marine environment. Allocating resources to shift towards a more circular economy would be greatly beneficial, as would adopting measures to reduce the usage of single-use plastics.  Integrating an impact assessment aspect in the future would expand and strengthen this footprinting methodology. However, this aspect still requires years of research to understand the full scale of threats presented by plastic pollution. Linking this impact assessment to ecosystem services could create a tool to evaluate the damages to both wildlife and human well-being, to help reduce negative impacts on the environment.", "sentences": [{"id": "9044a8662f56898366425127d2e9f0fbd345e272b07f7c0456d371a7d2d4d912.PG57.PA5.S0", "text": "The following areas of focus for future improvements to the methodology are suggested:  Building a consensus with industries on calculation rules and loss rates, as well as generic data to be used for calculations.
