It requires having detailed treatment information in project plans and involves comparing planning documents with data collected during and immediately after treatments are deployed. Implementation monitoring can also be done to assess whether treatments were located in areas that are the highest priorities for restoration (see Chapter 3),77 the extent to which treatments were implemented according to the prescription (for example, number of seedlings planted per hectare), as well as to assess variables related to the treatment itself (for example, flame length achieved for prescribed fire) or environmental conditions when the treatment was conducted (for example, temperature and moisture conditions). Information on the treatment is often necessary to interpret monitoring data. For instance, to understand the effects of a prescribed fire treatment, it is critical to know the number of monitoring plots that experienced fire and, for those that did, the intensity or severity of the fire.
