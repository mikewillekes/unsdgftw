For this purpose, our studies targeted 40 bird species of high concern out of 75 recorded species along the Lebanese shore line and for a distance of 7 km offshore. The number of threatened coastal and marine bird species has included 2 globally threatened species (Leachs Storm Petrel Hydrobates leucorhous [Vulnerable], and Yelkouan Shearwater Puffinus yelkouan [Vulnerable]), and 8 globally Near Threatened avian species. These results were behind our interest to better conserve these birds through raising awareness and improving policies and regulations and mainstreaming their conservation into national plans and coastal zone management plans, with the use of an atlas of the coastal and marine bird species that we have developed to enrich our knowledge for a better conservation strategy because it focuses on the numerical distribution of the recorded species together with their population size, abundance and phenology. v", "sentences": [{"id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.S1", "text": "Several categories of laws and regulations at national level contribute to protect coastal and seabirds of Lebanon from illegal killing and misguided management of their habitats."}, {"id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.S2", "text": "Still, there are illegal killing, poaching, poisoning and disturbance to the coastal and seabirds along the Lebanese coast."}, {"id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.S3", "text": "This atlas, with its content contributes to raising people awareness about the threats facing these birds and about the mitigation measures to be taken to conserve them in their appropriate habitats."}, {"id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.S4", "text": "Similarly, the atlas will inform the conservation experts in the country about the priority areas and keystone species that merit priority attention and protection."}, {"id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.S5", "text": "For this purpose, our studies targeted 40 bird species of high concern out of 75 recorded species along the Lebanese shore line and for a distance of 7 km offshore."}, {"id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.S6", "text": "The number of threatened coastal and marine bird species has included 2 globally threatened species, and 8 globally Near Threatened avian species."}, {"id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.S7", "text": "These results were behind our interest to better conserve these birds through raising awareness and improving policies and regulations and mainstreaming their conservation into national plans and coastal zone management plans, with the use of an atlas of the coastal and marine bird species that we have developed to enrich our knowledge for a better conservation strategy because it focuses on the numerical distribution of the recorded species together with their population size, abundance and phenology."}], "entities": [{"id": "8a57a440886c59423289560771b8ea67fd22967467cbe49ec10ebd6ac21948aa", "mention_id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.GPE0", "text": "Lebanon", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "38eeaf3733fe756a7d288f4a4c472d1c0bc2d0e58a80bdb3eb0500acf7a2c920", "mention_id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.NORP1", "text": "Lebanese", "label": "NORP"}, {"id": "38eeaf3733fe756a7d288f4a4c472d1c0bc2d0e58a80bdb3eb0500acf7a2c920", "mention_id": "db47099b00a0591bb7e86b2ba26d11167d8e7906e709e8a0a188ff145d2dddd2.PG6.PA1.NORP4", "text": "Lebanese", "label": "NORP"}]}
