This analysis is still relevant today, as illustrated by the results of the 2018 Economically Active Population Survey. In Spain, womens participation in the agricultural sector is scarce, accounting for 24 percent of employees. They also face greater insecurities: Forty-one percent of women working in the agriculture sector are unpaid, in comparison to 36 percent of men. Furthermore, there are comparatively more women than men working part-time, and fewer women have permanent contracts, 60 percent versus 64 percent of men. Domestic and care work is still womens main responsibility, and men are rarely involved. According to the Economically Active Population Survey, 22 percent of women working part-time list taking care of family members and other family issues as the reason, compared to 4 percent of men.

In Extremadura, there is also a greater difference in full-time and part-time employment for women and men.

Conversely, women only spend one hour and 20 minutes in productive work outside the home, while men dedicate five hours and 25 minutes (Haut-Commissariat au Plan, 2014). Barriers to womens economic empowerment include dependency on family work, which is largely unpaid; limited access to education, information, financial services and market and entrepreneurial opportunities; limited recognition of their local knowledge and resources; and strong gender-based division of roles and patriarchal norms that discriminate against women (Taqeem Initiative, 2018). In rural areas, 72 percent of women are illiterate in comparison to 40 percent in urban areas (HautCommissariat au Plan, 2013).", "sentences": [{"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.S0", "text": "10 population in rural areas, women are concentrated in the agriculture and industry sectors, accounting for 42.5 percent of workers in agriculture"}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.S1", "text": "Despite womens contribution to agriculture, their work is often not remunerated, or they work for lower wages."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.S2", "text": "According to 2018 employment data, 70.5 percent of employed rural women in Morocco were unpaid."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.S3", "text": "Women mainly participate in informal family farming and subsistence agriculture, which is seen as part of their household work and, in turn, remains unreported."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.S4", "text": "The time burden of household chores limits womens capacity to participate in the formal economy, yet their contributions to rural livelihoods are essential for rural development and the prosperity and well-being of their households."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.S5", "text": "According to Moroccos Time Use Survey, 95 percent of women spend on average five hours daily on domestic work, mainly inside the household, while men only dedicate an average of 43 minutes."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.S6", "text": "Conversely, women only spend one hour and 20 minutes in productive work outside the home, while men dedicate five hours and 25 minutes."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.S7", "text": "Barriers to womens economic empowerment include dependency on family work, which is largely unpaid; limited access to education, information, financial services and market and entrepreneurial opportunities; limited recognition of their local knowledge and resources; and strong gender-based division of roles and patriarchal norms that discriminate against women."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.S8", "text": "In rural areas, 72 percent of women are illiterate in comparison to 40 percent in urban areas."}], "entities": [{"id": "52118e19d4efe87556e2d64de6d32fe753ff0caee45d4c14ebbbe0a50d8a023d", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.GPE4", "text": "Morocco", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "af15f916637faa2439a671f2cb3f383b886bb767c7e7c082dd7363fa84b4d4f1", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.ORG5", "text": "Moroccos Time Use Survey", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "de9feaea8b66f7ba74845ee5fc156cdd22e8e4533de13ca76d71ac495da358ff", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG11.PA1.PHRASE0", "text": "gender", "label": "PHRASE"}]}

Employment rates in the Balearic Islands are higher than the national average, with 51 percent of women employed in 2018, in comparison to 44 percent at the national level. Yet gender inequalities persist, and the percentage of men employed in the Balearic Islands is higher, at 61 percent. Additionally, women are more likely to have part-time jobs than men. For example, 21 percent of women in 2018 were employed part-time in comparison to six percent of men (INE, 2018).", "sentences": [{"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.S0", "text": "As presented above in the section on Dehesas, womens contribution to the economy and sustainable development in rural Spain is often invisible, in part due to data scarcity on gender-differentiated roles."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.S1", "text": "Available data from the National Institute of Statistics shows that women comprise 30 percent of land owners in the Balearic Islands, yet only 24 percent of land managers  this implies that women may own land, but not manage it."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.S2", "text": "According to the 2018 Economically Active Population Survey, the agriculture sector in Spain only employs 4.2 percent of economically active people, a percentage that is even smaller in the Balearic Islands."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.S3", "text": "In the islands, agriculture employs just 0.5 percent of women and 2 percent of men, as the majority of employment is provided by the services sector, chiefly tourism."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.S4", "text": "Employment rates in the Balearic Islands are higher than the national average, with 51 percent of women employed in 2018, in comparison to 44 percent at the national level."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.S5", "text": "Yet gender inequalities persist, and the percentage of men employed in the Balearic Islands is higher, at 61 percent."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.S6", "text": "Additionally, women are more likely to have part-time jobs than men."}, {"id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.S7", "text": "For example, 21 percent of women in 2018 were employed part-time in comparison to six percent of men."}], "entities": [{"id": "4c799454ccf37279d378848bf41ad9ee12cc4f3d2a4740a54b42412c36af60c0", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.GPE0", "text": "Spain", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "242481eb1681bad885e7d78c7690ff539870c61b6c8bf5c14e528c92d3cfa328", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.ORG1", "text": "the National Institute of Statistics", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "66cb8e200ef625c7a75051065fd7271d55fb1c869224a6c317641ceb1f5bf4ad", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.LOC3", "text": "the Balearic Islands", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "4c799454ccf37279d378848bf41ad9ee12cc4f3d2a4740a54b42412c36af60c0", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.GPE6", "text": "Spain", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "66cb8e200ef625c7a75051065fd7271d55fb1c869224a6c317641ceb1f5bf4ad", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.LOC8", "text": "the Balearic Islands", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "66cb8e200ef625c7a75051065fd7271d55fb1c869224a6c317641ceb1f5bf4ad", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.GPE11", "text": "the Balearic Islands", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "66cb8e200ef625c7a75051065fd7271d55fb1c869224a6c317641ceb1f5bf4ad", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.GPE15", "text": "the Balearic Islands", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "de9feaea8b66f7ba74845ee5fc156cdd22e8e4533de13ca76d71ac495da358ff", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.PHRASE0", "text": "gender", "label": "PHRASE"}, {"id": "de9feaea8b66f7ba74845ee5fc156cdd22e8e4533de13ca76d71ac495da358ff", "mention_id": "0cd88b7cdf98e384a66a3dd14ec1dc88f07a0bff6ed30684fa4b03e756618cd9.PG16.PA3.PHRASE1", "text": "gender", "label": "PHRASE"}]}

The main differences exist between the European countries  Spain, Portugal and Greece  and the Southern Mediterranean countries  Morocco and Lebanon. These differences are marked by gender inequalities in legislation, economic participation and traditional gender roles. In Spain, Portugal and Greece, laws on property ownership and inheritance do not discriminate against women, while in Lebanon and Morocco, laws continue to favour men and sons, to the detriment of women and daughters. This limits womens ability to own and manage land in these countries. Traditional gender roles that discriminate against women and relegate them to domestic work also determine womens ability to participate in the labour market. For example, womens participation in the labour market in Lebanon and Morocco is lower than in European countries, and those that do work are mainly employed in the agriculture sector. Conversely, in Spain, Portugal and Greece, the majority of women are employed in the services sector, and their contribution to the agriculture sector is lower than in Lebanon and Morocco. These differences are partly explained by the development pace of each country. In Lebanon and Morocco, many men migrate to urban areas to work in industry and construction, leaving the women behind to oversee agricultural activities; this migration trend took place in Spain, Portugal and Greece during the second half of the 20th century. In recent years, this migration pattern has reverted in the northern regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in Spain, where more young women than men are currently moving to urban areas to seek education or employment, as they have fewer opportunities to work in agriculture. However, it is not possible to know if migration trends in Lebanon and Morocco will follow a similar pattern, as traditional gender norms are strongly rooted in these countries, including those that prevent many rural women from moving to urban areas without a male companion. Despite general similarities among the countries, more information is needed to properly identify and document both similarities and differences. The lack of information available, particularly pertaining to gender-differentiated roles in sustainable land management and conservation, limits the understanding of womens and mens roles in rural areas. As described above, some information and sex-disaggregated data is available, particularly relating to womens contribution to the economic sector and their traditional role in reproductive work as household managers and caretakers. Studies of womens roles in rural areas conclude that womens contributions tend to be undervalued, notably their role as caretakers, family helpers and transmitters of knowledge and traditional practices. However, information on womens contributions to the environment and conservation sectors is more limited.
