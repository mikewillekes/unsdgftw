Explicitly including World Heritage sites in countries national policies can contribute to international initiatives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate action plans (e.g., Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris agreement), and biodiversity strategies under the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, as they have the inherent potential to serve as living laboratories and trigger policy processes. For example, Gabons research programme at Lope National Park since the early 1980s has underpinned many of the countrys conservationand climate-related national policies.
