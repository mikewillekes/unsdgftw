Much of this work has focused on the paiche, providing key information on abundance and impacts, as well as potential for development. So far, these efforts have provided important information on:  Nutritional status and food security of rural and urban populations and key determinants, including the contributions of fish (Baker-French, 2013);  Fisheries and other livelihood activities, and local perspectives about paiche; and  Fishery value chains and mechanisms to improve transparency and promote greater economic equity between fishers, middlemen and markets (Macnaughton et al., 2016; Coca et al., 2012).  There have also been a range of practical initiatives, including:  Pilot initiatives for value-added fish production, for example, the establishment of a cooperative in one of the Indigenous communities, where paiche fillets and skins (for leather production) are produced and sold at improved prices;  Strengthening local fisheries organisations through ongoing dialogue, leadership training and providing technical assistance, i.e. consolidation of the regional fisher association; and  Engaging with local, regional and national level actors and promoting open spaces of dialogue (workshops, round table groups) to identify common interests, resolve conflicts and discuss future planning (Salas & Macnaughton, 2015).", "sentences": [{"id": "6428e11475c50bb3b573ac3ad04c39a8200f862f2cd16914cdceefcc0a68c6ae.PG145.PA5.S0", "text": "Since 2011, the Indigenous communities have engaged in research with the Asociacion Faunagua, World Fisheries Trust and the University of Victoria to better understand the fisheries situation, and identify pathways to improve livelihood and food security in the region."}, {"id": "6428e11475c50bb3b573ac3ad04c39a8200f862f2cd16914cdceefcc0a68c6ae.PG145.PA5.S1", "text": "Much of this work has focused on the paiche, providing key information on abundance and impacts, as well as potential for development."}, {"id": "6428e11475c50bb3b573ac3ad04c39a8200f862f2cd16914cdceefcc0a68c6ae.PG145.PA5.S2", "text": "So far, these efforts have provided important information on:  Nutritional status and food security of rural and urban populations and key determinants, including the contributions of fish;  Fisheries and other livelihood activities, and local perspectives about paiche; and  Fishery value chains and mechanisms to improve transparency and promote greater economic equity between fishers, middlemen and markets."}, {"id": "6428e11475c50bb3b573ac3ad04c39a8200f862f2cd16914cdceefcc0a68c6ae.PG145.PA5.S3", "text": " There have also been a range of practical initiatives, including:  Pilot initiatives for value-added fish production, for example, the establishment of a cooperative in one of the Indigenous communities, where paiche fillets and skins are produced and sold at improved prices;  Strengthening local fisheries organisations through ongoing dialogue, leadership training and providing technical assistance, i.e. consolidation of the regional fisher association; and  Engaging with local, regional and national level actors and promoting open spaces of dialogue to identify common interests, resolve conflicts and discuss future planning."}], "entities": [{"id": "b81121d9e19b9c7dfa89f39ccf23913c95be8c021c1905171632ec057fc9551b", "mention_id": "6428e11475c50bb3b573ac3ad04c39a8200f862f2cd16914cdceefcc0a68c6ae.PG145.PA5.ORG1", "text": "the Asociacion Faunagua", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "587e241a57a1ea887b656a288043dcb66dbb2ea68a84600b193e7330bb9f883e", "mention_id": "6428e11475c50bb3b573ac3ad04c39a8200f862f2cd16914cdceefcc0a68c6ae.PG145.PA5.ORG2", "text": "World Fisheries Trust", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "fb8851e5cc244292f3a11ce6be9c844b640eaee01d870cf328e5d549178b7045", "mention_id": "6428e11475c50bb3b573ac3ad04c39a8200f862f2cd16914cdceefcc0a68c6ae.PG145.PA5.ORG3", "text": "the University of Victoria", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "a2df80a4c1c1e0b49508f3d8b0b22f35cc29d3f8d01409cd7c175d5bbb3f2d47", "mention_id": "6428e11475c50bb3b573ac3ad04c39a8200f862f2cd16914cdceefcc0a68c6ae.PG145.PA5.ORG5", "text": "the regional fisher association", "label": "ORG"}]}
