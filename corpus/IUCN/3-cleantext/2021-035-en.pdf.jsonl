The first major algal bloom of U. prolifera occurred in 2008, during the Beijing Olympic Games, raising international awareness about the problem. The 600 km2 bloom lasted 46 days and required 5,000 people, 200 trucks and 1,185 fishing boats a day to eliminate algae from the sailing event area. This operation cost the organizers more than US$ 100 million (Wang et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2011), substantially higher than profits gained by the local seaweed (Porphyra yezoensis) aquaculture industry, which accounted for US$ 53 million (Hu et al., 2010).", "sentences": [{"id": "228549d3d76181c65ae2d2a6667a10f2952ad05b71b1a8becb6dcff760d1ea3e.PG23.PA5.S0", "text": "Algal blooms have also become an annual summer event in the Chinas Yellow Sea."}, {"id": "228549d3d76181c65ae2d2a6667a10f2952ad05b71b1a8becb6dcff760d1ea3e.PG23.PA5.S1", "text": "The green tides of Ulva prolifera are not necessarily toxic for human health, but as the bloom peaks and then declines, the decomposition releases noxious gases."}, {"id": "228549d3d76181c65ae2d2a6667a10f2952ad05b71b1a8becb6dcff760d1ea3e.PG23.PA5.S2", "text": "The first major algal bloom of U. prolifera occurred in 2008, during the Beijing Olympic Games, raising international awareness about the problem."}, {"id": "228549d3d76181c65ae2d2a6667a10f2952ad05b71b1a8becb6dcff760d1ea3e.PG23.PA5.S3", "text": "The 600 km2 bloom lasted 46 days and required 5,000 people, 200 trucks and 1,185 fishing boats a day to eliminate algae from the sailing event area."}, {"id": "228549d3d76181c65ae2d2a6667a10f2952ad05b71b1a8becb6dcff760d1ea3e.PG23.PA5.S4", "text": "This operation cost the organizers more than US$ 100 million, substantially higher than profits gained by the local seaweed aquaculture industry, which accounted for US$ 53 million."}], "entities": [{"id": "80d5074b6bd38b7beaca5a8203f14acf63c0b6636ac0a7eb8407b91fda2300ba", "mention_id": "228549d3d76181c65ae2d2a6667a10f2952ad05b71b1a8becb6dcff760d1ea3e.PG23.PA5.LOC2", "text": "the Chinas Yellow Sea", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "da1f44ded3c32c4e51a3b4603a478dd5c204a7e741fabfa672ef987439dcbd2f", "mention_id": "228549d3d76181c65ae2d2a6667a10f2952ad05b71b1a8becb6dcff760d1ea3e.PG23.PA5.LOC3", "text": "Ulva prolifera", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "a6cdabd709c2228169c6f4be607534e2ca61aaa34797588109f6d054b8e7a5ab", "mention_id": "228549d3d76181c65ae2d2a6667a10f2952ad05b71b1a8becb6dcff760d1ea3e.PG23.PA5.LOC5", "text": "U. prolifera", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "c1cf69bcbf7975f41dae94a3e2109d396edbaa114f044558e6bdef3fc15c75d8", "mention_id": "228549d3d76181c65ae2d2a6667a10f2952ad05b71b1a8becb6dcff760d1ea3e.PG23.PA5.EVENT7", "text": "the Beijing Olympic Games", "label": "EVENT"}]}
