Early stages of restoration often provide greater regulatory services, with older stages providing greater provisioning services, such as timber products (Naime et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2019). Generally, forests can increase infiltration of water into the ground but this does not make up for very high interception and evaporation losses, so that overall forests reduce water yield downstream in the same catchment (Filoso et al., 2017; Acreman et al., 2021), even if potentially increasing water yield elsewhere via increased precipitation. Furthermore, headwater wetlands normally increase floods and reduce water resources (Bullock & Acreman, 2003; Acreman et al., 2021). In arid and semi-arid regions, increased vegetation cover from restoration can decrease water flows (Shi et al., 2021). Additionally, restoration of urban wetlands can expose humans to mosquitoand other vector-borne diseases; and the maintenance of large woody debris in rivers to provide fish habitat can create a recreational hazard (Finlayson and Horwitz, 2015). These realities highlight the need to develop a shared understanding of benefits and potential costs that different groups may experience from restoration over time to motivate people and mobilise resources (Boedhihartono and Sayer, 2012).", "sentences": [{"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG30.PA10.S0", "text": "Critical trade-offs among different ecological, economic and social objectives and outcomes may emerge in a restoration programme."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG30.PA10.S1", "text": "Restoration may create winners and losers and inescapable trade-offs."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG30.PA10.S2", "text": "Natures contributions to people will vary over time and space."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG30.PA10.S3", "text": "Early stages of restoration often provide greater regulatory services, with older stages providing greater provisioning services, such as timber products."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG30.PA10.S4", "text": "Generally, forests can increase infiltration of water into the ground but this does not make up for very high interception and evaporation losses, so that overall forests reduce water yield downstream in the same catchment, even if potentially increasing water yield elsewhere via increased precipitation."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG30.PA10.S5", "text": "Furthermore, headwater wetlands normally increase floods and reduce water resources."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG30.PA10.S6", "text": "In arid and semi-arid regions, increased vegetation cover from restoration can decrease water flows."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG30.PA10.S7", "text": "Additionally, restoration of urban wetlands can expose humans to mosquitoand other vector-borne diseases; and the maintenance of large woody debris in rivers to provide fish habitat can create a recreational hazard."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG30.PA10.S8", "text": "These realities highlight the need to develop a shared understanding of benefits and potential costs that different groups may experience from restoration over time to motivate people and mobilise resources."}], "entities": []}

Community-based restoration of degraded subtropical thickets in South Africa aims to achieve broad climate mitigation and adaptation goals as well as enhancing local livelihoods and economies (Favretto et al., 2018). Climate change also brings risks and challenges for ecosystem restoration, emphasising the importance of identifying sources of ecological resilience as a critical step in restoring ecosystems in a changing climate (Timpane-Padgham et al., 2017). The ecosystem attributes of species diversity and connectivity are commonly considered to confer resilience because they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems (Timpane-Padgham et al., 2017).", "sentences": [{"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S1", "text": "Ecosystem restoration in the context of climate change"}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S2", "text": "As terrestrial ecosystems recover, carbon accumulates in aboveand below-ground biomass and soils, providing a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide that can partially counteract carbon sources and mitigate climate change, in addition to providing other ecological and socio-economic benefits."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S3", "text": "In regions of China where six major forest restoration projects were conducted since the 1970s, over half of the total annual carbon sequestration during 20002010 was attributed to implementation of restoration projects."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S4", "text": "Restored coastal wetlands, such as mangroves, seagrasses and salt marshes, can also be important sinks storing carbon on a larger area basis compared to inland wetlands."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S5", "text": "Although they occupy less than 0.05% of the worlds ocean surface area, these blue carbon ecosystems store 5070% of the total carbon stored in ocean sediment."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S6", "text": "Carbon capture and storage on abandoned farmland can be accelerated via managing plant diversity through restoration approaches, creating and applying biochar to soil, and co-developing renewable energy technologies."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S7", "text": "Grassland restoration significantly increased carbon in soils based on experimental studies in China and Kenya."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S8", "text": "Restoration is also a means to address climate adaptation in the context of sustainable development, while also contributing to climate mitigation."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S9", "text": "Community-based restoration of degraded subtropical thickets in South Africa aims to achieve broad climate mitigation and adaptation goals as well as enhancing local livelihoods and economies."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S10", "text": "Climate change also brings risks and challenges for ecosystem restoration, emphasising the importance of identifying sources of ecological resilience as a critical step in restoring ecosystems in a changing climate."}, {"id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.S11", "text": "The ecosystem attributes of species diversity and connectivity are commonly considered to confer resilience because they apply to a wide variety of species and ecosystems."}], "entities": [{"id": "50c0152c2952082aeaf427885a2f617d67cf6de183a8816c0955ea5b875a216b", "mention_id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.GPE2", "text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "50c0152c2952082aeaf427885a2f617d67cf6de183a8816c0955ea5b875a216b", "mention_id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.GPE10", "text": "China", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "3b5f7a488f457a7e53fea34f11eb7848d1325be3d892fc5761bd7778d34dc4a8", "mention_id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.GPE11", "text": "Kenya", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "7a80542464c08d20997598a0382b5393e499e94ed9405cd4add66b4b0a2dbbc4", "mention_id": "9aedc6d4b9d25327b0fb90c96e457811d7cc3b47cf25f464c121fe42b5e8c544.PG49.PA3.GPE12", "text": "South Africa", "label": "GPE"}]}
