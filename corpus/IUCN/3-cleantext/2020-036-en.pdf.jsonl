In 2017, the World Bank reported a total of 43,146 listed domestic companies in the world (World Bank, n.d.a), while 125 million formal MSME (micro, small and medium enterprise) were reported in the Country Indicators of 132 economies in August 2010, including 89 million in emerging markets (Kushnir et al., 2010).", "sentences": [{"id": "2b7d32c555d10a3666726df47e9fef60225eec6556dbc7bb16514fe8592429bf.PG101.PA4.S0", "text": "Beyond MNEs closely scrutinised by investors or exposed to reputational risk, it is difficult to estimate how many companies, even multinational, go under the radar when it comes to sustainability."}, {"id": "2b7d32c555d10a3666726df47e9fef60225eec6556dbc7bb16514fe8592429bf.PG101.PA4.S1", "text": "In a policy report dated May 2018, OECD points at the limited data available regarding the number of MNEs in the world."}, {"id": "2b7d32c555d10a3666726df47e9fef60225eec6556dbc7bb16514fe8592429bf.PG101.PA4.S2", "text": "The most recent figure on the number of non-financial transnational corporations was 82,000 in 2010 according to UNCTAD."}, {"id": "2b7d32c555d10a3666726df47e9fef60225eec6556dbc7bb16514fe8592429bf.PG101.PA4.S3", "text": "In 2017, the World Bank reported a total of 43,146 listed domestic companies in the world, while 125 million formal MSME were reported in the Country Indicators of 132 economies in August 2010, including 89 million in emerging markets."}], "entities": [{"id": "6b1c64c81e672e6f21afe9dccf30cce43307bfe101a1ef54e03c1af42d5811d3", "mention_id": "2b7d32c555d10a3666726df47e9fef60225eec6556dbc7bb16514fe8592429bf.PG101.PA4.ORG1", "text": "OECD", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "15c6f170386cb0cbbf4afea703e0d9205f33278accf10a3989d0cbbf8fcfae50", "mention_id": "2b7d32c555d10a3666726df47e9fef60225eec6556dbc7bb16514fe8592429bf.PG101.PA4.ORG4", "text": "UNCTAD", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "ec80eba460f5b1903b5633ac8a6f00be5d84b2a49a569a9cd37aec94863e40d2", "mention_id": "2b7d32c555d10a3666726df47e9fef60225eec6556dbc7bb16514fe8592429bf.PG101.PA4.ORG6", "text": "the World Bank", "label": "ORG"}]}
