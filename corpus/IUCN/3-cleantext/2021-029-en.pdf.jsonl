The world faces many challenges, not the least of which is the ongoing catastrophic loss of biodiversity and its associated life-support systems. The destruction and degradation of nature also occasions the disruption of water supplies, food security, climate stability, security in the face of natural disasters, and undermines human health and well-being. Protected and conserved areas when effectively governed and managed can avert these negative consequences, and provide evidence and lessons for ecosystem management across the production landscape and seascape. Conservation managers and stewards of nature face direct threats and challenges to the integrity and persistence of the areas for which they are responsible. Among the arguments for addressing threats and investing in conservation practice are the wider social and economic values of these areas.", "sentences": [{"id": "ed8b6052d6f99464860a2d82f1ef3cdc2591f937661d8f0d72c6b67985e0f7e0.PG8.PA2.S0", "text": "Protected and conserved areas are established, governed or managed to maintain their significant values for society."}, {"id": "ed8b6052d6f99464860a2d82f1ef3cdc2591f937661d8f0d72c6b67985e0f7e0.PG8.PA2.S1", "text": "While always having outcomes that include the persistence of ecosystems, species and genes both locally and in the wider landscape and seascape, they also have a diversity of ecosystem functions that are valuable for human livelihoods, health and well-being."}, {"id": "ed8b6052d6f99464860a2d82f1ef3cdc2591f937661d8f0d72c6b67985e0f7e0.PG8.PA2.S2", "text": "In many cases, the rationale for their existence is precisely because they are so valuable to people."}, {"id": "ed8b6052d6f99464860a2d82f1ef3cdc2591f937661d8f0d72c6b67985e0f7e0.PG8.PA2.S3", "text": "The world faces many challenges, not the least of which is the ongoing catastrophic loss of biodiversity and its associated life-support systems."}, {"id": "ed8b6052d6f99464860a2d82f1ef3cdc2591f937661d8f0d72c6b67985e0f7e0.PG8.PA2.S4", "text": "The destruction and degradation of nature also occasions the disruption of water supplies, food security, climate stability, security in the face of natural disasters, and undermines human health and well-being."}, {"id": "ed8b6052d6f99464860a2d82f1ef3cdc2591f937661d8f0d72c6b67985e0f7e0.PG8.PA2.S5", "text": "Protected and conserved areas when effectively governed and managed can avert these negative consequences, and provide evidence and lessons for ecosystem management across the production landscape and seascape."}, {"id": "ed8b6052d6f99464860a2d82f1ef3cdc2591f937661d8f0d72c6b67985e0f7e0.PG8.PA2.S6", "text": "Conservation managers and stewards of nature face direct threats and challenges to the integrity and persistence of the areas for which they are responsible."}, {"id": "ed8b6052d6f99464860a2d82f1ef3cdc2591f937661d8f0d72c6b67985e0f7e0.PG8.PA2.S7", "text": "Among the arguments for addressing threats and investing in conservation practice are the wider social and economic values of these areas."}], "entities": []}
