Food provisioning services and traditional medicines are also key and the dependence of many communities on natural resources for survival is high. In a research undertaken in an area adjacent to Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in Zambia in 2017, it was found that 79% of the 136 community households interviewed collect the natural resources from around the village, with 5% saying that they collect from inside the forest reserve and 2% collect inside the National Park; it is illegal to collect in either of these places.

These include village land forest reserves (VLFRs) which are managed by villages, as well as community forest reserves (CFRs) which may be managed by a sub-group of people within the village. This legal and policy framework is highly supportive of community management and ownership of forests, and has led to the rapid expansion of statutorily recognized local forest reserves (mainly VLFRs). Consequently, village land forests are recognised in law as a viable and increasingly important part of the forest estate under formal protection.", "sentences": [{"id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.S0", "text": "Tanzanias forest policy and legislation also builds on the land tenure and local governance institutions present in the country to provide strong enabling conditions for local communities to own and manage forests."}, {"id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.S1", "text": "While Tanzanias historical forest management framework emphasized legal restrictions on harvesting and the establishment of central forest reserves, starting in the mid-1990s Tanzania began some formal experimentation with community-based forest management."}, {"id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.S2", "text": "In 1998 the country adopted a National Forestry Policy which aims to strengthen the legal framework for the promotion of private and community-based ownership of forests and trees."}, {"id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.S3", "text": "The Forest Act 2002 was subsequently passed calling for forests to be managed at the lowest possible level of government and providing flexible institutional arrangements for local forest management and ownership."}, {"id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.S4", "text": "These include village land forest reserves which are managed by villages, as well as community forest reserves which may be managed by a sub-group of people within the village."}, {"id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.S5", "text": "This legal and policy framework is highly supportive of community management and ownership of forests, and has led to the rapid expansion of statutorily recognized local forest reserves."}, {"id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.S6", "text": "Consequently, village land forests are recognised in law as a viable and increasingly important part of the forest estate under formal protection."}], "entities": [{"id": "dfcc27b36f91944adf3836d592e5a3aca6e66f3c48265459f7fc79b263a67f0c", "mention_id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.NORP0", "text": "Tanzanias", "label": "NORP"}, {"id": "dfcc27b36f91944adf3836d592e5a3aca6e66f3c48265459f7fc79b263a67f0c", "mention_id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.LOC1", "text": "Tanzanias", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "74947702044149ef93770757be7871d8aaadc966338e735d6cc21ac8609c9b77", "mention_id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.GPE3", "text": "Tanzania", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "fc9c5dcc1e189a663b5a19165271cff6d09d61ddb2d619b4e903ee72238682e0", "mention_id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.LAW5", "text": "a National Forestry Policy", "label": "LAW"}, {"id": "93fea9e11f8bca5408679f2e6fcaaf6e1b219047e93f3d0e96a3be4dce1fcfff", "mention_id": "9e11d05c66a3c90795d9c1c7a86732575a3ed2b0d19052e7a480e1175c25e1ec.PG181.PA5.LAW6", "text": "The Forest Act 2002", "label": "LAW"}]}

A number of innovative financing mechanisms have been developed globally, such as:  Debt-for-nature swaps. A debt-for-nature swap is an agreement that reduces a developing countrys debt stock or service in exchange for a commitment to protect nature from the debtor government. These are voluntary transactions whereby the donor(s) cancels part or all of the debt owned by a developing countrys government. In exchange, the debtor government commits to invest the accrued savings in biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation and landscape conservation. One such is the Seychelles Blue Bond.  Taxation incentives, where landowners get a tax deduction for their conservation commitment when declaring nature reserves on privately owned land, such as in South Africa, see Box 10.3.  Biodiversity offsets compensate for the net impacts of a development project after other mitigation measures have been implemented. Offsets should aim to achieve no net loss and preferably a net gain of biodiversity. Offsets can, for example, deliver biodiversity benefits through a transaction, where offset sellers sell offsets to developers who seek to compensate the net biodiversity loss resulting from their activities.  Carbon offset programmes, such as the Wildlife Works Kasigau REDD+ Project in Kenya. While carbon offsets can generate finance for conservation, it can only do so if there is a buyer willing to offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits from a protected area or conservation project. Carbon laws can overcome this hurdle by compelling polluters to purchase carbon credits.  Conservation Trust Funds, such as in Uganda, the Biodiversity Conservation Trust Fund. Conservation Trust Funds, sometimes called environmental funds, are defined as private, legally independent grantmaking institutions that provide sustainable financing for biodiversity conservation and often finance part of the long-term management costs of a countrys protected area system or a specific protected area.  Species impact bonds, such as the Rhino Impact Bond.  Payment for Ecosystem Services, such as the Kilombero Plantation Limited PES project.  Outcomes-based financing mechanisms are innovative financing instruments that attract investment capital to address issues traditionally funded by the public sector. Species bonds or protected area bonds are an example of such mechanisms. They are investment instruments with a set maturity, whose aim is to grow a sample of the population of a selected species at key sites. Investors in the bond receive a financial return only on the completion of the objective, with that return being funded by outcome payers.  Green bonds can be used to fund a broad range of projects, which includes renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable waste management, sustainable land use, biodiversity conservation, clean transportation, and clean water. However, green bonds have not yet been used to fund conservation at scale. In 2017, it was estimated that only 2% of bond proceeds went to land conservation and 4% to biodiversity conservation.  Blue bonds. When a countrys government commits to protect part of their near-shore ocean areas and engage in conservation work, the cost of such a transition is often high, especially for Small Island States. Blue bonds help finance this transition: a government issues a bond, often with the assistance/ guarantee of an NGO and/or an agency such as the World Bank, leading to potentially lower interest rates and longer repayment periods. A portion of those savings fund the new marine protected areas and the conservation activities to which the country has committed.  Project Finance for Permanence uses a project finance technique to facilitate full and upfront funding of large-scale conservation projects or areas by bringing together funders in one closing. Examples of such deals include a US$ 57 million deal to protect 2 million hectares in Costa Rica and a US$ 215 million project to conserve 60 million hectares of the Brazilian Amazon. By addressing piecemeal or insufficient funding upfront, it ensures that conservation interventions are properly planned and permanent and fully funded.
