The intent of this figure is to show changes in precipitation over regional monsoon domains in terms of observed past trends, how greenhouse gases and aerosols relate to these changes, and in terms of future projections in one intermediate emission scenario in the near, medium and long terms. Global and regional monsoons domains. The global monsoon is defined as the area with local summer-minus-winter precipitation rate exceeding 2.5 mm day1. The regional monsoon domains are defined based on published literature and expert judgement, and also accounting for the fact that the climatological summer monsoon rainy season varies across the individual regions. Assessed regional monsoons are South and Southeast Asia, East Asia, West Africa, North America, South America, Australia and Maritime Continent Monsoon. Equatorial South America and South Africa regions are also shown, as they receive unimodal summer seasonal rainfall although their qualification as monsoons is subject to discussion. Global and regional monsoons precipitation trends based on DAMIP CMIP6 simulations with both natural and anthropogenic, GHG only, aerosols only and natural only radiative forcing. Weighted ensemble means are based on nine CMIP6 models contributing to the MIP. Observed trends computed from CRU GPCP, and APHRO datasets are shown as well.

Since AR5, there is increasing attention on the need for coordination among previously independent international agendas, recognizing that climate change, disaster risk, economic development, biodiversity conservation and human well-being are tightly interconnected. The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an example of the need for such interconnection, with its widespread impacts on economy, society and environment. Cross Chapter Box 6.1 in Chapter 6 assesses the consequences of the COVID-19 lockdowns on emissions of GHGs and SLCFs and related implications for the climate. Another example is the close link between SLCF emissions, climate evolution and air quality concerns. Emissions of halocarbons have previously been successfully regulated under the Montreal Protocol and its Kigali Amendment. This has been achieved in an effort to reduce ozone depletion that has also modulated anthropogenic climate influence. In the process, emissions of some SLCFs are jointly regulated to reduce environmental and health impacts from air pollution. Considering the recognized importance of SLCFs for climate, the IPCC decided in May 2019 to approve that the IPCC Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories produces an IPCC Methodology Report on SLCFs to develop guidance for national SLCFs inventories. The evolving governance context since AR5 challenges the IPCC to provide policymakers and other actors with information relevant for both adaptation to and mitigation of climate change and for the loss and damage induced. 1.2.3 Linking science and society: communication, values, and the IPCC assessment process This section assesses how the process of communicating climate information has evolved since AR5. It summarizes key issues regarding scientific uncertainty addressed in previous IPCC assessments and introduces the IPCC calibrated uncertainty language. Next it discusses the role of values in problem-driven, multidisciplinary science assessments such as this one. The section introduces climate services and how climate information can be tailored for greatest utility in specific contexts, such as the global stocktake. Finally, we briefly evaluate changes in media coverage of climate information since AR5, including the increasing role of internet sources and social media. 1.2.3.1 Climate change understanding, communication, and uncertainties The response to climate change is facilitated when leaders, policymakers, resource managers, and their constituencies share basic understanding of the causes, effects, and possible future course of climate change. Achieving shared understanding is complicated, since scientific knowledge interacts with pre-existing conceptions of weather and climate built up in diverse world cultures over centuries and often embedded in strongly held values and beliefs stemming from ethnic or national identities, traditions, religion, and lived relationships to weather, land and sea. These diverse, more local understandings can both contrast with and enrich the planetary-scale analyses of global climate science. Political cultures also give rise to variation in how climate science knowledge is interpreted, used, and challenged. A meta-analysis of 87 studies carried out between 1998 and 2016 found that political orientation and political party identification were the second-most important predictors of views on climate change after environmental values. Ruiz et al. systematically reviewed 34 studies of non-US nations or clusters of nations and 30 studies of the USA alone. They found that in the non-US studies, changed weather and socio-altruistic values were the most important drivers of public attitudes. For the USA case, by contrast, political affiliation and the influence of corporations were most important. Widely varying media treatment of climate issues also affects public responses. In summary, environmental and socio-altruistic values are the most significant influences on public opinion"}

Furthermore, climate change itself is not uniform. Some regions face steady, readily observable change, while others experience high variability that masks underlying trends; most regions are subject to hazards, but some may also experience benefits, at least temporarily. This non-uniformity may lead to wide variation in public climate change awareness and risk perceptions at multiple scales. For example, short-term temperature trends, such as cold spells or warm days, have been shown to influence public concern. Given these manifold influences and the highly varied contexts of climate change communication, special care is required when expressing findings and uncertainties, including IPCC assessments that inform decision making. Throughout the IPCCs history, all three Working Groups have sought to explicitly assess and communicate scientific uncertainty. Over time, the IPCC has developed and revised a framework to treat uncertainties consistently across assessment cycles, reports, and Working Groups through the use of calibrated language. Since its First Assessment Report, the IPCC specified terms and methods for communicating authors expert judgments. During the AR5 cycle, this calibrated uncertainty language was updated and unified across all WGs. Box 1.1 summarizes this framework as used in AR6. Box 1.1: Treatment of uncertainty and calibrated uncertainty language in AR6 The AR6 follows the approach developed for AR5, as described in the Guidance Notes for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on Consistent Treatment of Uncertainties. The uncertainty Guidance Note used in AR6 clarifies the relationship between the qualitative description of confidence and the quantitative representation of uncertainty expressed by the likelihood scale. The calibrated uncertainty language emphasizes traceability of the assessment throughout the process. Key chapter findings presented in the chapter Executive Summary are supported in the chapter text by a summary of the underlying literature that is assessed in terms of evidence and agreement, confidence, and also likelihood if applicable. In all three WGs, author teams evaluate underlying scientific understanding and use two metrics to communicate the degree of certainty in key findings. These metrics are:"}

Each group aggregates the raw measurement data, applies various adjustments for non-climatic biases such as urban heat-island effects, and addresses unevenness in geospatial and temporal sampling with various techniques. Other research groups provide alternative interpolations of these datasets using different methods. Using the then available global surface temperature datasets, WGI AR5 assessed that the global mean surface temperature increased by 0.85C from 1880 to 2012 and found that each of the three decades following 1980 was successively warmer at the Earths surface than any preceding decade since 1850. Marine air temperatures, especially those measured during night-time, are increasingly also used to examine variability and long-term trends. Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 in Chapter 2 discusses updates to the global temperature datasets, provides revised estimates for the observed changes and considers whether marine air temperatures are changing at the same rate as SSTs. Data at altitude came initially from scattered mountain summits, balloons, and kites, but the upper troposphere and stratosphere were not systematically observed until radiosonde networks emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. These provide the longest continuous quasi-global record of the atmospheres vertical dimension. New methods for spatial and temporal homogenisation of radiosonde records were introduced in the 2000s. Since 1978, Microwave Sounding Units mounted on Earth-orbiting satellites have provided a second high-altitude data source, measuring temperature, humidity, ozone, and liquid water throughout the atmosphere. Over time, these satellite data have required numerous adjustments to account for such factors as orbital precession and decay. Despite repeated adjustments, however, marked differences remain in the temperature trends from surface, radiosonde, and satellite observations; between the results from three research groups that analyse satellite data; and between modelled and satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends. These differences are the subject of ongoing research. In the 2000s, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder and radio occultation measurements provided new ways to measure temperature at altitude, complementing data from the MSU. GNSS-RO is a new independent, absolutely calibrated source, using the refraction of radio-frequency signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System to measure temperature, pressure, and water vapour. Heat-retaining properties of the atmospheres constituent gases were closely investigated in the 19th century. Foote, measured solar heating of CO2 experimentally and argued that higher concentrations in the atmosphere would increase Earths temperature. Water vapour, ozone, carbon dioxide, and certain hydrocarbons were found to absorb longwave radiation, the principal mechanism of the greenhouse effect. 19th-century investigators also established the existence of a natural biogeochemical carbon cycle. CO2 emitted by volcanoes is removed from the atmosphere through a combination of silicate rock weathering, deep-sea sedimentation, oceanic absorption, and biological storage in plants, shellfish, and other organisms. On multi-million-year timescales, the compression of fossil organic matter stores carbon as coal, oil, and natural gas. Arrhenius calculated that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would produce a 56C warming, but in 1900 new measurements seemed to rule out CO2 as a greenhouse gas due to overlap with the absorption bands of water vapour. Further investigation and more sensitive instruments later overturned Angstroms conclusion. Nonetheless, the major role of CO2 in the energy balance of the atmosphere was not widely accepted until the 1950s. Revelle and Keeling established carbon dioxide monitoring stations in Antarctica and Hawaii during the 19571958 International Geophysical Year. These stations have tracked rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 315 ppm in 1958 to 414 ppm in 2020. Ground-based monitoring of other greenhouse gases followed. The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite was launched in 2009, and two Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellite instruments have been in orbit since 2014."}

The width of the taper gives an indication of the amount of available records. 1.3.2 Lines of evidence: paleoclimate With the gradual acceptance of geological deep time in the 19th century came investigation of fossils, geological strata, and other evidence pointing to large shifts in the Earths climate, from ice ages to much warmer periods, across thousands to billions of years. This awareness set off a search for the causes of climatic changes. The long-term perspective provided by paleoclimate studies is essential to understanding the causes and consequences of natural variations in climate, as well as crucial context for recent anthropogenic climatic change. The reconstruction of climate variability and change over recent millennia began in the 1800s. In brief, paleoclimatology reveals the key role of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in past climatic variability and change, the magnitude of recent climate change in comparison to past glacial-interglacial cycles, and the unusualness recent climate change. FAQ 1.3 provides a plain-language summary of its importance. Paleoclimate studies reconstruct the evolution of Earths climate over hundreds to billions of years using preinstrumental historical archives, indigenous knowledge and natural archives left behind by geological, chemical, and biological processes. Paleoclimatology covers a wide range of temporal scales, ranging from the human historical past to geological deep time. Paleoclimate reference periods are presented in Cross Chapter Box 2.1 in Chapter 2. Historical climatology aids near-term paleoclimate reconstructions using media such as diaries, almanacs, and merchant accounts that describe climate-related events such as frosts, thaws, flowering dates, harvests, crop prices, and droughts. Meticulous records by Chinese scholars and government workers, for example, have permitted detailed reconstructions of Chinas climate back to 1000 CE, and even beyond. Climatic phenomena such as large-scale, regionally and temporally distributed warmer and cooler periods of the past 2000 years were originally reconstructed from European historical records. Indigenous and local knowledge have played an increasing role in historical climatology, especially in areas where instrumental observations are sparse. Peruvian fishermen named the periodic El Nino warm current in the Pacific, linked by later researchers to the Southern Oscillation. Inuit communities have contributed to climatic history and community based monitoring across the Arctic. Indigenous Australian knowledge of climatic patterns has been offered as a complement to sparse observational records, such as those of sea-level"}

To assess their quality, models or compontents of models may be compared with observations. For this reason, they can be used to attribute observed climatic effects to different natural and human drivers. As early as Arrhenius, simple mathematical models were used to calculate the effects of doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide over pre-industrial concentrations. In the early 1900s Bjerknes formulated the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics for motion of the atmosphere, and Richardson developed a system for numerical weather prediction based on these equations. When electronic computers became available in the late 1940s, the methods of Bjerknes and Richardson were successfully applied to weather forecasting. In the 1960s similar approaches to modelling the weather were used to model the climate, but with much longer runs than daily forecasting. Simpler statistical and oneand two-dimensional modelling approaches continued in tandem with the more complex General Circulation Models. The first coupled atmosphere-ocean model with realistic topography appeared in 1975. Rapid increases in computer power enabled higher resolutions, longer model simulations, and the inclusion of additional physical processes in GCMs, such as aerosols, atmospheric chemistry, sea ice, and snow. In the 1990s, AOGCMs were state of the art. By the 2010s, Earth system models incorporated land surface, vegetation, the carbon cycle, and other elements of the climate system. Since the 1990s, some major modelling centres have deployed unified models for both weather prediction and climate modelling, with the goal of a seamless modelling approach that uses the same dynamics, physics, and parameterisations at multiple scales of time and space. Because weather forecast models make short-term predictions that can be frequently verified, and improved models are introduced and tested iteratively on cycles as short as 18 months, this approach allows major portions of the climate model to be evaluated as a weather model and more frequently improved. However, all climate models exhibit biases of different degrees and types, and the practice of tuning parameter values in models to make their outputs match variables such as historical warming trajectories has generated concern throughout their history. Overall, the WGI AR5 assessed that climate models had improved since previous reports . Since climate models vary along many dimensions, such as grid type, resolution, and parameterizations, comparing their results requires special techniques. To address this problem, the climate modelling community developed increasingly sophisticated Model Intercomparison Projects. MIPs prescribe standardised experiment designs, time periods, output variables, or observational reference data, to facilitate direct comparison of model results. This aids in diagnosing the reasons for biases and other differences among models, and furthers process understanding. Both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 model intercomparison projects included experiments testing the ability of models to reproduce 20th century global surface temperature trends both with and without anthropogenic forcings. Although some individual model runs failed to achieve this, the mean trends of multi-model ensembles did so successfully. When only natural forcings were included, similar multimodel ensembles could not reproduce the observed post-1970 warming at either global or regional scales. The GCMs and ESMs compared in CMIP6 offer more explicit documentation and evaluation of tuning procedures; see Section 1.5). The FAR concluded that while both theory and models suggested that anthropogenic warming was already well underway, its signal could not yet be detected in observational data against the noise of natural variability (also see Barnett and Schlesinger and Section 1.4.2). Since then, increased warming and progressively more conclusive attribution studies have identified human activities as"}

These climate changes have contributed to desertification and land degradation in many regions. Increased urbanisation can enhance warming in cities and their surroundings, especially during heat waves, and intensify extreme rainfall. With respect to the ocean, the SROCC assessed that it is virtually certain that the ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat contributed by global warming. The rate of ocean warming has likely more than doubled since 1993. Over the period 19822016, marine heatwaves have very likely doubled in frequency and are increasing in intensity. In addition, the surface ocean acidified further and loss of oxygen occurred from the surface to a depth of 1000 m. The report expressed medium confidence that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation weakened in 20042017 relative to 18501900. Concerning the cryosphere, the SROCC reported widespread continued shrinking of nearly all components. Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet tripled over the period 20072016 relative to 19972006, while mass loss doubled for the Greenland Ice Sheet. The report concludes with very high confidence that due to the combined increased loss from the ice sheets, global mean sea level rise has accelerated. The rate of recent GMSL rise is about 2.5 times larger than for 19011990. The report also found that Arctic sea ice extent has very likely decreased for all months of the year since 1979 and that September sea ice reductions of 12.82.3% per decade are likely unprecedented for at least 1000 years. Feedbacks from the loss of summer sea ice and spring snow cover on land have contributed to amplified warming in the Arctic, where surface air temperature likely increased by more than double the global average over the last two decades. By contrast, Antarctic sea ice extent overall saw no statistically significant trend for the period 1979 to 2018. The SROCC assessed that anthropogenic climate change has increased observed precipitation, winds, and extreme sea level events associated with some tropical cyclones. It also found evidence for an increase in annual global proportion of Category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades. 2) Drivers of climate change The SRCCL stated that the land is simultaneously a source and sink of CO2 due to both anthropogenic and natural drivers. It estimates with medium confidence that Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use activities accounted for around 13% of CO2, 44% of methane, and 82% of nitrous oxide emissions from human activities during 20072016, representing 23% of the total net anthropogenic emissions of GHGs. The natural response of land to human-induced environmental change such as increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, and climate change, caused a net CO2 sink equivalent of around 29% of total CO2 emissions; however, the persistence of the sink is uncertain due to climate change. The SRCCL also assessed how changes in land conditions affect global and regional climate. It found that changes in land cover have led to both a net release of CO2, contributing to global warming, and an increase in global land albedo, causing surface cooling. However, the report estimated that the resulting net effect on globally averaged surface temperature was small over the historical period. The SROCC found that the carbon content of Arctic and boreal permafrost is almost twice that of the atmosphere, and assessed medium evidence with low agreement that thawing northern permafrost regions are currently releasing additional net methane and CO2. 3) Projections of climate change"}

However, even though warming from anthropogenic emissions will persist for centuries to millennia and will cause ongoing long-term changes, past emissions alone are unlikely to raise global surface temperatur to 1.5C above 1850-1900 levels. The SR1.5 also found that reaching and sustaining net zero anthropogenic CO2 emissions and reducing net non-CO2 radiative forcing would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal time scales. The maximum temperature reached is then determined by cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions up to the time of net zero CO2 emissions and the level of non-CO2 radiative forcing in the decades prior to the time that maximum temperatures are reached. Furthermore, climate models project robust differences in regional climate characteristics between the present day and a global warming of 1.5C, and between 1.5C and 2C, including mean temperature in most land and ocean regions and hot extremes in most inhabited regions. There is medium confidence in robust differences in heavy precipitation events in several regions and the probability of droughts in some regions. The SROCC projected that global-scale glacier mass loss, permafrost thaw, and decline in snow cover and Arctic sea ice extent will continue in the near term due to surface air temperature increases. The Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are projected to lose mass at an increasing rate throughout the 21st century and beyond. Sea level rise will also continue at an increasing rate. For the period 20812100 with respect to 19862005, the likely ranges of global mean sea level rise are projected at 0.260.53 m for RCP2.6 and 0.510.92 m for RCP8.5. For the RCP8.5 scenario, projections of GMSL rise by 2100 are higher by 0.1 m than in AR5 due to a larger contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Extreme sea level events that occurred once per hundred years in the recent past are projected to occur at least once per year at many locations by 2050, especially in tropical regions, under all RCP scenarios. According to SR1.5, by 2100, GMSL rise would be around 0.1 m lower with 1.5C global warming compared to 2C. If warming is held to 1.5, GMSLwill still continue to rise well beyond 2100, but at a slower rate and a lower magnitude. However, instability and/or irreversible loss of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, resulting in multimetre rise in sea level over hundreds to thousands of years, could be triggered at 1.5C to 2C of global warming. According to the SROCC, sea level rise in an extended RCP2.6 scenario would be limited to around 1 m in 2300 while multi-metre sea-level rise is projected under RCP8.5 by then. The SROCC projected that over the 21st century, the ocean will transition to unprecedented conditions with increased temperatures, further acidification, and oxygen decline. Marine heatwaves are projected to become more frequent as are extreme El Nino and La Nina events. The AMOC is projected to weaken during the 21st century, but a collapse is deemed very unlikely. 4) Emission pathways to limit global warming The SR1.5 focused on emission pathways and system transitions consistent with 1.5C global warming over the 21st century. Building upon the understanding from WGI AR5 of the quasi-linear relationship between cumulative net anthropogenic CO2 emissions since 18501900 and maximum global mean temperature, the report assessed the remaining carbon budgets compatible with the 1.5C or 2C warming goals of the Paris Agreement. Starting from year 2018, the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C is about 580 GtCO2, and about 420 GtCO2 for a two-in-three chance. At constant 2017 emissions, these budgets would be depleted by about the years 2032 and 2028, respectively. Using GMST instead of GSAT gives estimates of 770 and 570 GtCO2, respectively. Each budget is further reduced by approximately 100 GtCO2 over the course of this century when permafrost and other less well represented Earth-system feedbacks are taken into account."}

Samset, Peter Thorne. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperatures to specific thresholds above pre-industrial levels. In AR6 WGI, as in previous IPCC reports, observations and projections of changes in global temperature are generally expressed relative to 18501900 as an approximate pre-industrial state. This is a pragmatic choice based upon data availability considerations, though both anthropogenic and natural changes to the climate occurred before 1850. The remaining carbon budgets, the chance of crossing global temperature thresholds, and projections of extremes and sea level rise at a particular level of global warming can all be sensitive to the chosen definition of the approximate pre-industrial baseline. This Cross-Chapter Box assesses the evidence on change in radiative forcing and global temperature from the period around 1750 to 18501900; variations in the climate before 1750 are discussed in Chapter 2. Although there is some evidence for human influence on climate before 1750, the magnitude of the effect is still disputed, and most studies analyse the human influence on climate over the industrial period. Historically, the widespread use of coal-powered machinery started the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the late 18th century, but the global effects were small for several decades. In line with this, previous IPCC assessment reports considered changes in radiative forcing relative to 1750, and temperature changes were often reported relative to the late 19th century. AR5 and SR1.5 made the specific pragmatic choice to approximate pre-industrial global temperatures by the average of the 18501900 period, when permanent surface observing networks emerged that provide sufficiently accurate"}

The relative importance of these two factors depends on the climate variable or region of interest. Natural variations consist of both natural radiatively forced trends and internal fluctuations of the climate system which occur even in the absence of any radiative forcings. The internal modes of variability, such as ENSO and the NAO, are discussed further in Annex IV. 1.4.2.1 Climate variability can influence trends over short periods Natural variations in both weather and longer timescale phenomena can temporarily obscure or intensify any anthropogenic trends. These effects are more important on small spatial and temporal scales but can also occur on the global scale as well. Since AR5, many studies have examined the role of internal variability through the use of large ensembles. Each such ensemble consists of many different simulations by a single climate model for the same time period and using the same radiative forcings. These simulations differ only in their phasing of the internal climate variations. A set of illustrative examples using one such large ensemble demonstrates how variability can influence trends on decadal timescales. The long-term anthropogenic trends in this set of climate indicators are clearly apparent when considering the ensemble as a whole, and all the individual ensemble members have very similar trends for ocean heat content, which is a robust estimate of the total energy stored in the climate system. However, the individual ensemble members can exhibit very different decadal trends in global surface air temperature, UK summer temperatures, and Arctic sea-ice variations. More specifically, for a representative 11-year period, both positive and negative trends can be found in all these surface indicators, even though the long-term trend is for increasing temperatures and decreasing sea ice. Periods in which the long-term trend is substantially obscured or intensified for more than 20 years are also visible in these regional examples, highlighting that observations are expected to exhibit short-term trends which are larger or smaller than the long-term trend or differ from the average projected trend from climate models, especially on continental spatial scales or smaller. The actual observed trajectory can be considered as one realisation of many possible alternative worlds which experienced different weather, as also demonstrated by the construction of observation-based large ensembles that are alternate possible realisations of historical observations, which retain the statistical properties of observed regional weather.

Other sources of uncertainty, such as model response uncertainty, can in principle be reduced, but are not amenable to a frequency-based interpretation of probability, and Bayesian methods to quantify the uncertainty have been considered instead. The scenario uncertainty component is distinct from other uncertainties, given that future anthropogenic emissions can be considered as the outcome of a set of societal choices. For climate model projections it is possible to approximately quantify the relative amplitude of various sources of uncertainty. A range of different climate models are used to estimate the model response uncertainty to a particular emissions pathway, and multiple pathways are used to estimate the scenario uncertainty. The unforced component of internal variability can be estimated from individual ensemble members of the same climate model. Figure 1.15 illustrates the relative size of these different uncertainty components using a cascade of uncertainty, with examples shown for global mean temperature, northern South American annual temperatures and East Asian summer precipitation changes. For global mean temperature, the role of internal variability is small, and the total uncertainty is dominated by emissions scenario and model response uncertainties. Note that there is considerable overlap between individual simulations for different emissions scenarios even for the mid-term. For example, the slowest-warming simulation for SSP5-8.5 produces less mid-term warming than the fastest-warming simulation for SSP1-1.9. For the long-term, emissions scenario uncertainty becomes dominant. The relative uncertainty due to internal variability and model uncertainty increases for smaller spatial scales. In the regional example shown for changes in temperature, the same scenario and model combination has produced two simulations which differ by 1C in their projected 20812100 averages due solely to internal climate variability. For regional precipitation changes, emissions scenario uncertainty is often small relative to model response uncertainty. In the example shown, the SSPs overlap considerably, but SSP1-1.9 shows the largest precipitation change in the near-term even though global mean temperature warms the least; this is due to differences between regional aerosol emissions projected in this and other scenarios. These cascades of uncertainty would branch out further if applying the projections to derive estimates of changes in hazard. Figure 1.15: The cascade of uncertainties in CMIP6 projections.

In the context of climate change, risks can arise not only from impacts of climate change, but also from potential human responses to climate change. Relevant adverse consequences include those on lives, livelihoods, health and wellbeing, economic, social and cultural assets and investments, infrastructure, services, ecosystems and species. In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system to hazards. Hazards, exposure and vulnerability may each be subject to uncertainty in terms of magnitude and likelihood of occurrence, and each may change over time and space due to socio-economic changes and human decisionmaking. In the context of climate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not achieving the intended objective(s), or from potential trade-offs with, or negative side-effects on, other societal objectives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. Risks can arise for example from uncertainty in implementation, effectiveness or outcomes of climate policy, climate-related investments, technology development or adoption, and system transitions. The following concepts are also relevant for the definition of risk: Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected. Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. Hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental resources. Impacts: The consequences of realised risks on natural and human systems, where risks result from the interactions of climate-related hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods, health and wellbeing, ecosystems and species, economic, social and cultural assets, services, and infrastructure. Impacts may be referred to as consequences or outcomes, and can be adverse or beneficial. Risk in AR6 WGI The revised risk framing clarifies the role and contribution of WGI to risk assessment. Risk in IPCC terminology applies only to human or ecological systems, not to physical systems on their own. Climatic impact-drivers: CIDs are physical climate system conditions that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions. In AR6, WGI uses the term climatic impact-drivers to describe changes in physical systems rather than hazards, because the term hazard already assumes an adverse consequence. The terminology of climatic impact-driver therefore allows WGI to provide a more value-neutral characterisation of climatic changes that may be relevant for understanding potential impacts, without pre-judging whether specific climatic changes necessarily lead to adverse consequences, as some could also result in beneficial outcomes depending on the specific system and associated values. Chapter 12 and the Atlas assess and provide information on climatic impact-drivers for different regions and sectors to support and link to WGII"}

Although CIDs can lead to adverse or beneficial outcomes, focus is given to CIDs connected to hazards, and hence inform risk. Extremes are a category of CID, corresponding to unusual events with respect to the range of observed values of the variable. Chapter 11 assesses changes in weather and climate extremes, their attribution and future projections. As examples of the use of this terminology, the term flood risk should not be used if it only describes changes in the frequency and intensity of flood events; the risk from flooding to human and ecological systems is caused by the flood hazard, the exposure of the system affected and the vulnerability of the system. As another example, climate-related risk to food security can arise from both potential climate change impacts and responses to climate change and can be exacerbated by other stressors. Drivers for risks related to climate change impacts include climate hazards, mediated by other climatic impact-drivers, the potential for indirect climate-related impacts, exposure of people and vulnerability or adaptability. Information provided by WGI may or may not be relevant to understand risks related to climate change responses. For example, the risk to a company arising from emissions pricing, or the societal risk from reliance on an unproven mitigation technology, are not directly dependent on actual or projected changes in climate but arise largely from human choices. However, WGI climate information may be relevant to understand the potential for maladaptation, such as the potential for specific adaptation responses not achieving the desired outcome or having negative side-effects. For example, WGI information about the range of sea level rise can help inform understanding of whether coastal protection, accommodation, or retreat would be the most effective risk management strategy in a particular context. From a WGI perspective also relevant for risk assessment are low-likelihood high impact events and the concept of deep uncertainty. Low-likelihood, high-impact events: These are events whose probability of occurrence is low but whose potential impacts on society and ecosystems are high. To better inform risk assessment and decision making, such low likelihood outcomes are described as they may be associated with very high levels of risk and because the greatest risks might not be associated with the most expected outcome. The AR6 WGI report provides more detailed information about these types of events compared to the AR5. Recognising the need for assessing and managing risk in situations of high uncertainty, the SROCC advanced the treatment of situations with deep uncertainty; Section 1.2.3). A situation of deep uncertainty exists when experts or stakeholders do not know or cannot agree on: appropriate conceptual models that describe relationships among key driving forces in a system; the probability distributions used to represent uncertainty about key variables and parameters; and/or how to weigh and value desirable alternative outcomes. The concept of deep uncertainty can complement the IPCC calibrated language and thereby broaden the communication of risk. 1.4.4.3 Abrupt change, tipping points and surprises"}

The most established method is to identify the fingerprint of the expected space-time response to a particular climate forcing agent such as the concentration of anthropogenically induced greenhouse gases or aerosols, or natural variation of solar radiation. This technique disentangles the contribution of individual forcing agents to an observed change. New statistical approaches have been applied to better account for internal climate variability and the uncertainties in models and observations. There are many other approaches, for example, global mean sea-level change has been attributed to anthropogenic climate forcing by attributing the individual contributions from, for example, glacier melt or thermal expansion, while also examining which aspects of the observed change are inconsistent with internal variability. Specific regional conditions and responses may simplify or complicate attribution on those scales. For example, some human forcings, such as regional land use change or aerosols, may enhance or reduce regional signals of change (Lejeune et al., 2018; Undorf et al., 2018; Boe et al., 2020; Thiery et al., 2020; see also WGI Chapter 10, Section 10.4.2; WGI Chapter 11, Sections 11.1.6 and 11.2.2. In general, regional climate variations are larger than the global mean climate, adding additional uncertainty to attribution. These statistical limitations may be reduced by process-based attribution, focusing on the physical processes known to influence the response to external forcing and internal variability. Attribution of weather and climate events to anthropogenic forcing New methods have emerged since AR5 to attribute the change in likelihood or characteristics of weather or climate events or classes of events to underlying drivers. Typically, historical changes, simulated under observed forcings, are compared to a counterfactual climate simulated in the absence of anthropogenic forcing. Another approach examines facets of the weather and thermodynamic status of an event through process-based attribution. Events where attributable human influences have been found include hot and cold temperature extremes, heavy precipitation, and certain types of droughts and tropical cyclones. Event attribution techniques have sometimes been extended to end-to-end assessments from climate forcing to the impacts of events on natural or human systems. Attribution of observed changes in natural or human systems to climate-related drivers The attribution of observed changes to climate-related drivers across a diverse set of sectors, regions and systems is part of each chapter in the WGII contribution to the AR6 and is synthesised in WGII Chapter 16. The number of attribution studies on climate change impacts has grown substantially since AR5, generally leading to higher confidence levels in attributing the causes of specific impacts. New studies include the attribution of changes in socio-economic indicators such as economic damages due to river floods, the occurrence of heat related human mortality or economic inequality. Impact attribution covers a diverse set of qualitative and quantitative approaches, building on experimental approaches, observations from remote sensing, long-term in situ observations, and monitoring efforts, teamed with local knowledge, process understanding and empirical or dynamical modelling.

There are several approaches to the classification of climate regions. When climate observation data was sparse and limited, the aggregation of climate variables was implicitly achieved through the consideration of biomes, giving rise to the traditional vegetation-based classification of Koppen. In the last decades, the substantial increases in climate observations, climate modelling, and data processing capabilities have allowed new approaches to climate classification, e.g., through interpolation of aggregated global data from thousands of stations or through data-driven approaches applied to delineate ecoregions that behave in a coherent manner in response to climate variability. Experience shows that each method has strengths and weaknesses through trade-offs between detail and convenience. For instance, a very detailed classification, with numerous complexly shaped regions derived from a large set of variables, may be most useful for the evaluation of climate models and climate projections. In contrast, geometrically simple regions are often best suited for regional climate modelling and downscaling (e.g., the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment domains; see Giorgi and Gutowski, 2015, and Section 1.5.3). 1.4.5.2 Types of regions used in AR6 IPCCs recognition of the importance of regional climates can be traced back to its First Assessment Report, where climate projections for 2030 were presented for five subcontinental regions. In subsequent reports, there has been a growing emphasis on the analysis of regional climate, including two special reports: one on regional impacts and another on extreme events. A general feature of previous IPCC reports is that the number and coverage of climate regions vary according to the subject and across WGs. Such varied definitions have the advantage of optimizing the results for a particular application, whereas variable region definitions may have the disadvantage of hindering multidisciplinary assessments and comparisons between studies or WGs. In this Report, regional climate change is primarily addressed through the introduction of four classes of regions. The first two are the unified WGI Reference Sets of Land and Ocean Regions, which are used in the entire Report. These are supplemented by additional sets of Typological Regions  used in Chapters 5, 812 and Atlas  and Continental Regions, which are mainly used for linking Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas with WGII. All four classes of regions are defined and described in detail in the Atlas. Here we summarize their basic features. Figure 1.18: Main types of regions used in this report. AR6 WGI Reference Set of Land and Ocean Regions, consisting of 46 land regions and 15 ocean regions, including 3 hybrid regions that are both land and ocean regions.

A comparison with the previous reference regions of AR5 WGI is presented in the Atlas. Example of typological regions: monsoon domains adopted in Chapter 8. Acronyms are explained on the right of the map. The black contour lines represent the global monsoon zones, while the coloured regions denote the regional monsoon domains. The two stippled regions do receive seasonal rainfall, but their classification as monsoon regions is still under discussion. Continental Regions used mainly in Chapter 12 and the Atlas. Stippled zones define areas that are assessed in both regions. Small Islands are ocean regions containing small islands with consistent climate signals and/or climatological coherence."}

Attribution assessments can be made at a higher likelihood level than AR5, due in part to the availability of longer observational datasets. Updated assessments are made based on new and improved datasets, for example of global temperature change or regional climate information. Of particular relevance to the AR6 assessment are the Essential Climate Variables, and Essential Ocean Variables, compiled by the Global Climate Observing System, and the Global Ocean Observing System, respectively. These variables include physical, chemical, and biological variables or groups of linked variables and underpin headline indicators for climate monitoring. We highlight below the key advances in observational capacity since the AR5, including major expansions of existing observational platforms as well as new and/or emerging observational platforms that play a key role in AR6. We then discuss potential near-term losses in key observational networks due to climate change or other adverse human-caused influence. 1.5.1.1 Major expansions of observational capacity Atmosphere, land and hydrological cycle Satellites provide observations of a large number of key atmospheric and land surface variables, ensuring sustained observations over wide areas. Since AR5, such observations have expanded to include satellite retrievals of atmospheric CO2 via the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellites, following on from similar efforts employing the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite. Improved knowledge of fluxes between the atmosphere and land surface results from combining remote sensing and in situ measurements. FLUXNET has been providing eddy covariance measurements of carbon, water, and energy fluxes between the land and the atmosphere, with some of the stations operating for over 20 years, while the Baseline Surface Radiation Network has been maintaining high-quality radiation observations since the 1990s. Observations of the composition of the atmosphere have been further improved through expansions of existing surface observation networks and through in situ measurements such as aircraft campaigns. Examples of expanded networks include Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace Gases Research InfraStructure, which focuses on short-lived climate forcers, and the Integrated Carbon Observation System, which allows scientists to study and monitor the global carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions. Examples of recent aircraft observations include the Atmospheric Tomography Mission, which has flown repeatedly along the north-south axis of both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and the continuation of the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System effort, which measures atmospheric composition from commercial aircraft. Two distinctly different but important remote sensing systems can provide information about temperature and humidity since the early 2000s. Global Navigation Satellite Systems radio occultation and limb soundings provide information, although only data for the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are suitable to support climate change assessments. These measurements complement those from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder. AIRS has limitations in cloudy conditions, although these limitations have been partly solved using new methods of analysis. These new data sources now have a sufficient length of the record to strengthen the analysis of atmospheric warming in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.2."}

A decade of observations of sea-surface salinity is now available via the SMOS and SMAP satellite retrievals, providing continuous and global monitoring of surface salinity in the open ocean and coastal areas for the first time. The global network of tide gauges, complemented by a growing number of satellite-based altimetry datasets, allows for more robust estimates of global and regional sea level rise. Incorporating vertical land motion derived from the Global Positioning System, the comparison with tide gauges has allowed the correction of a drift in satellite altimetry series over the period 19931999, thus improving our knowledge of the recent acceleration of sea level rise. These datasets, combined with Argo and observations of the cryosphere, allow a consistent closure of the global mean sea level budget. Cryosphere For the cryosphere, there has been much recent progress in synthesizing global datasets covering larger areas and longer time periods from multi-platform observations. For glaciers, the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers, which combines data on glacier fluctuations, mass balance and elevation change with glacier outlines and ice thickness, has expanded and provided input for assessing global glacier evolution and its role in sea level rise. New data sources include archived and declassified aerial photographs and satellite missions, and high-resolution digital elevation models. Improvements have also been made in the monitoring of permafrost. The Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost provides long-term records of permafrost temperature and active layer thickness at key sites to assess their changes over time. Substantial improvements to our assessments of large-scale snow changes come from intercomparison and blending of several datasets, for snow water equivalent and snow cover extent, and from bias corrections of combined datasets using in situ data. The value of gravity-based estimates of changes in ice sheet mass has increased as the time series from the GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites, homogenised and absolutely calibrated, is close to 20 years in length. The ESAs Cryosat-2 radar altimetry satellite mission has continued to provide measurements of the changes in the thickness of sea ice and the elevation of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets. Other missions include NASAs Operation IceBridge, collecting airborne remote sensing measurements to bridge the gap between ICESat and the upcoming ICESat-2 laser altimetry missions. Longer time series from multiple missions have led to considerable advances in understanding the origin of inconsistencies between the mass balances of different glaciers and reducing uncertainties in estimates of changes in the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets. Last, the first observed climatology of snowfall over Antarctica was obtained using the cloud/precipitation radar onboard NASAs CloudSat.

The representation of ocean and cryosphere processes has also evolved significantly since CMIP5. The explicit representation of ocean eddies, due to increased grid resolution, is a major advance in a number of CMIP6 ocean model components. Advances in sea ice models have been made, for example, through correcting known shortcomings in CMIP5 simulations, in particular the persistent underestimation of the rapid decline in summer Arctic sea ice extent. The development of glacier and ice-sheet models has been motivated and guided by an improved understanding of key physical processes, including grounding line dynamics, stratigraphy and microstructure evolution, sub-shelf melting, and glacier and ice-shelf calving, among others. The resolution of ice sheet models has continuously increased, including the use of nested grids, sub-grid interpolation schemes, and adaptive mesh approaches, mainly for a more accurate representation of groundingline migration and data assimilation. Ice-sheet models are increasingly interactively coupled with global and regional climate models, accounting for the height mass-balance feedback, and enabling a better representation of ice-ocean processes, in particular for the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Sea level rise is caused by multiple processes acting on multiple time scales: ocean warming, glaciers and ice sheet melting, change in water storage on land, glacial isostatic adjustment but no single model can represent all these processes. In this report, the contributions are computed separately and merged into a common probabilistic framework and updated from AR5. Another notable development since AR5 is the inclusion of stochastic parameterizations of sub-grid processes in some comprehensive climate models. Here, the deterministic differential equations that govern the dynamical evolution of the model are complemented by knowledge of the stochastic variability in unresolved processes. While not yet widely implemented, the approach has been shown to improve the forecasting skill of weather models, to reduce systematic biases in global models and to influence simulated climate sensitivity. Representation of biogeochemistry, including the carbon cycle Since AR5, more sophisticated land use and land cover change representations in ESMs have been developed to simulate the effects of land management on surface fluxes of carbon, water and energy, although the integration of many processes remains a challenge. The importance of nitrogen availability to limit the terrestrial carbon sequestration has been recognised and so an increasing number of models now include a prognostic representation of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle and its coupling to the land carbon cycle, leading to a reduction in uncertainty for carbon budgets. As was the case in CMIP5, the land surface processes represented vary across CMIP6 models, with at least some key processes absent from any particular ESM land model. Ocean biogeochemical models have evolved to enhance the consistency of the exchanges between ocean, atmosphere and land, through riverine input and dust deposition. Other developments include flexible plankton stoichiometric ratios, improvements in the representation of nitrogen fixation, and the limitation of plankton growth by iron. Due to the long time scale of biogeochemical processes, spin-up strategies have been shown to affect the performance of models used in AR5. 1.5.3.2 Model tuning and adjustment When developing climate models, choices have to be made in a number of areas.

This section presents recent developments in techniques and approaches to robustly extract, quantify and compare results from multiple, independent climate models, and how their performance can be assessed and validated. 1.5.4.1 Model fitness for purpose A key issue addressed in this report is whether climate models are adequate or fit for purposes of interest, that is, whether they can be used to successfully answer particular research questions, especially about the causes of recent climate change and the future evolution of climate. Assessment of a models fitness-for-purpose can be informed both by how the model represents relevant physical processes and by relevant performance metrics. The processes and metrics that are most relevant can vary with the question of interest, for example, a question about changes in deep ocean circulation versus a question about changes in regional precipitation. New model evaluation tools and emergent constraint methodologies can also aid the assessment of fitness-for-purpose, especially in conjunction with process understanding. The broader availability of large model ensemble may allow for novel tests of fitness that better account for natural climate variability. Fitness-for-purpose of models used in this report is discussed in Chapter 3 for the global scale, in Chapter 10 for regional climate, and in the other chapters at the process level. Typical strategies for enhancing the fitness-for-purpose of a model include increasing resolution in order to explicitly simulate key processes, improving relevant parameterizations, and careful tuning. Changes to a model that enhance its fitness for one purpose can sometimes decrease its fitness for others, by upsetting a pre-existing balance of approximations. When it is unclear whether a model is fit for a purpose of interest, there is often a closely-related purpose for which the evidence of fitness is clearer; for example, it might be unclear whether a model is fit for providing highly accurate projections of precipitation changes in a region, but reasonable to think that the model is fit for providing projections of precipitation changes that cannot yet be ruled out. Such information about plausible or credible changes can be useful to inform adaptation. Note that challenges associated with assessing model fitness-for-purpose need not prevent reaching conclusions with high confidence if there are multiple other lines of evidence supporting those same conclusions. 1.5.4.2 Ensemble modelling techniques A key approach in climate science is the comparison of results from multiple model simulations with each"}

These simulations have typically been performed by separate models with consistent boundary conditions and prescribed emissions or radiative forcings, as in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases. Such multi-model ensembles have proven highly useful in sampling and quantifying model uncertainty, within and between generations of climate models. They also reduce the influence on projections of the particular sets of parametrizations and physical components simulated by individual models. The primary usage of MMEs is to provide a well quantified model range, but when used carefully they can also increase confidence in projections. Presently, however, many models also share provenance and may have common biases that should be acknowledged when presenting and building on MME-derived conclusions. Since AR5, an increase in computing power has made it possible to investigate simulated internal variability and to provide robust estimates of forced model responses, using Large Initial Condition Ensembles, also referred to as Single Model Initial condition Large Ensembles. Examples using GCMs or ESMs that support assessments in AR6 include the CESM Large Ensemble, the MPI Grand Ensemble, and the CanESM2 large ensembles. Such ensembles employ a single GCM or ESM in a fixed configuration, but starting from a variety of different initial states. In some experiments, these initial states only differ slightly. As the climate system is chaotic, such tiny changes in initial conditions lead to different evolutions for the individual realizations of the system as a whole. Other experiments start from a set of well-separated ocean initial conditions to sample the uncertainty in the circulation state of the ocean and its role in longer-timescale variations. These two types of ICEs have been referred to as micro and macro perturbation ensembles respectively. In support of this report, most models contributing to CMIP6 have produced ensembles of multiple realizations of their historical and scenario simulations. Recently, the ICE technique has been extended to atmosphere-only simulations, singleforcer influences such as volcanic eruptions to regional modelling and to attribution of extreme weather events using crowd-sourced computing. ICEs can also be used to evaluate climate model parameterizations, if models are initialized appropriately, mostly within the framework of seamless weather and climate predictions. Initializing an atmospheric model in hindcast mode and observing the biases as they develop permits testing of the parameterized processes, by starting from a known state rather than one dominated by quasi-random short term variability. However, single-model initial-conditions ensembles cannot cover the same degrees of freedom as a multi-model ensemble, because model characteristics substantially affect model behaviour. A third common modelling technique is the perturbed parameter ensemble. These methods are used to assess uncertainty based on a single model, with individual parameters perturbed to reflect the full range of their uncertainty. Statistical methods can then be used to detect which parameters are the main causes of uncertainty across the ensemble. PPEs have been used frequently in simpler models, such as EMICs, and are being applied to more complex models. A caveat of PPEs is that the estimated uncertainty will depend on the specific parameterizations of the underlying model and may well be an underestimation of the true uncertainty. It is also challenging to disentangle forced responses from internal variability using a PPE alone. Together, the three ensemble methods allow investigation of climate model uncertainty arising from internal variability, initial and internal boundary conditions, model formulations and parameterizations. Figure 1.21 illustrates the different ensemble types. Recent studies have also started combining multiple ensemble types or using ensembles in combination with statistical analytical techniques. For example, Murphy et al. combine MMEs and PPEs to give a fuller assessment of"}

Wagman and Jackson use PPEs to evaluate the robustness of MME-based emergent constraints. Sexton et al. study the robustness of ICE approaches by identifying parameters and processes responsible for model errors at the two different timescales. Overall, we assess that increases in computing power and the broader availability of larger and more varied ensembles of model simulations have contributed to better estimations of uncertainty in projections of future change. Note, however, that despite their widespread use in climate science today, the cost of the ensemble approach in human and computational resources, and the challenges associated with the interpretation of multi-model ensembles, has been questioned. Figure 1.21: Illustration of common types of model ensemble, simulating the time evolution of a quantity Q. Multi-model ensemble, where each model has its own realization of the processes affecting Q, and its own internal variability around the baseline value. The multi-model mean is commonly taken as the ensemble average. Initial condition ensemble, where several realizations from a single model are compared. These differ only by minute perturbations to the initial conditions of the simulation, such that over time, internal variability will progress differently in each ensemble member. Perturbed physics ensemble, which also compares realizations from a single model, but where one or more internal parameters that may affect the simulations of Q are systematically changed to allow for a quantification of the effects of those quantities on the model results. Additionally, each parameter set may be taken as the starting point for an initial condition ensemble. In this figure, each set has three ensemble members. 1.5.4.3 The sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project provides a framework to compare the results of different GCMs or ESMs performing similar experiments. Since its creation in the mid-1990s, it has evolved in different phases, involving all major climate modelling centres in the world. The results of these phases have played a key role in previous IPCC reports, and the present Report assesses a range of results from CMIP5 that were not published until after the AR5, as well as the first results of the 6th phase of CMIP. The CMIP6 experiment design is somewhat different from previous phases. It now consists of a limited set of DECK simulations and an historical simulation that must be performed by all participating models, as well as a wide range of CMIP6-endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects covering specialized topics. Each MIP activity consists of a series of model experiments, documented in the literature and in an online database (https://es-doc.org, see Pascoe et al. and Annex II). The CMIP DECK simulations form the basis for a range of assessments and projections in the following chapters. As in CMIP5, they consist of a pre-industrial control simulation, an idealized, abrupt quadrupling of CO2 concentrations relative to piControl, a 1% per year increase in CO2 concentrations relative to piControl, and a transient simulation with prescribed sea-surface temperatures for the period 19792014. In addition, all participating models perform a historical simulation for the period 18502014. For the latter, common CMIP6 forcings are prescribed. Depending on the model setup, these include emissions and concentrations of short-lived species, long-lived greenhouse gases, biomass burning emissions, global gridded land use forcing data, solar forcing, and stratospheric aerosol data from volcanoes. The methods for generating gridded datasets are described in. For AMIP simulations, common sea surface temperatures"}

Dynamical and statistical downscaling techniques can provide higher-resolution climate information than is available directly from global climate models.

In support of AR6, CORDEX has undertaken a new experiment where regional climate models downscale a common set of global model simulations, performed at a coarser resolution, to a spatial resolution spanning from 12 to 25 km over most of the CORDEX domains. CORDEXCORE represents an improved level of coordinated intercomparison of downscaling models. 1.5.4.5 Model Evaluation Tools For the first time in CMIP, a range of comprehensive evaluation tools are now available that can run alongside the commonly used distributed data platform Earth System Grid Federation, to produce comprehensive results as soon as the model output is published to the CMIP archive. For instance, the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool is used by a number of chapters. It is an open-source community software tool that includes a large variety of diagnostics and performance metrics relevant for coupled Earth System processes, such as for the mean, variability and trends, and it can also examine emergent constraints. ESMValTool also includes routines provided by the WMO Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices for the evaluation of extreme events and diagnostics for key processes and variability. Another example of evaluation tool is the CLIVAR 2020 ENSO metrics package. These tools are used in several chapters of this report for the creation of the figures that show CMIP results. Together with the Interactive Atlas, they allow for traceability of key results, and an additional level of quality control on whether published figures can be reproduced. It also provides the capability to update published figures with, as much as possible, the same set of models in all figures, and to assess model improvements across different phases of CMIP. These new developments are facilitated by the definition of common formats for CMIP model output and the availability of reanalyses and observations in the same format as CMIP output. The tools are also used to support routine evaluation at individual model centres and simplify the assessment of improvements of individual models or generations of model ensembles. Note, however, that while tools such as ESMValTool can produce an estimate of overall model performance, dedicated model evaluation still needs to be performed when analysing projections for a particular purpose, such as assessing changing hazards in a given particular region. Such evaluation is discussed in the next section, and in greater detail in later chapters of this Report. 1.5.4.6 Evaluation of process-based models against observations Techniques used for evaluating process-based climate models against observations were assessed in AR5, and have progressed rapidly since. The most widely used technique is to compare climatologies or time series of simulated model output with observations, considering the observational uncertainty. A further approach is to compare the results of process-based models with those from statistical models. In addition to a comparison of climatological means, trends and variability, AR5 already made use of a large set of performance metrics for a quantitative evaluation of the models. Since AR5, a range of studies has investigated model agreement with observations well beyond large scale mean climate properties, providing information on the performance of recent model simulations across multiple variables and components of the Earth system. Based on such studies, this Report assesses model improvements across different CMIP"}

Their conclusions should also be reassessed when a new generation of MMEs becomes available, such as CMIP6. As an example, Chapter 7 discusses and assesses recent studies where equilibrium climate sensitivities diagnosed in a multi-model ensemble are compared with the same models estimates of an observable quantity, such as post-1970s global warming or tropical sea-surface temperatures of past climates like the last glacial maximum or the Pliocene. Assessments of other emergent constraints appear throughout later chapters, such as Chapter 4, Chapter 5 and Chapter 7. Figure 1.23: The principle of emergent constraints. An ensemble of models defines a relationship between an observable, mean, trend or variation in the climate and an uncertain projection, climate sensitivity or feedback. An observation of the x-axis variable can then be combined with the model-derived relationship to provide a tighter estimate of the climate projection, sensitivity or feedback on the y-axis. 1.5.4.8 Weighting techniques for model comparisons Assessments of climate model ensembles have commonly assumed that each individual model is of equal value and when combining simulations to estimate the mean and variance of quantities of interest, they are typically unweighted. This practice has been noted to diminish the influence of models exhibiting a good match with observations. However, exceptions to this approach exist, notably AR5 projections of sea ice, which only selected a few models which passed a model performance assessment, and more studies on this topic have appeared since the AR5. Ensembles are typically sub-selected by removing either poorly performing model simulations or model simulations that are perceived to add little additional information, typically where multiple simulations have come from the same model. They may also be weighted based on model performance. Several recent studies have attempted to quantify the effect of various strategies for selection or weighting of ensemble members based on some set of criteria. Model weighting strategies have been further employed since AR5 to reduce the spread in climate projections for a given scenario by using weights based on one or more model performance metrics. However, models may share representations of processes, parameterization schemes, or even parts of code, leading to common biases. The models may therefore not be fully independent, calling into question inferences derived from multi-model ensembles. Emergent constraints also represent an implicit weighting technique that explicitly links present performance to future projections. Concern has been raised about the large extent to which code is shared within the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble. Boe showed that a clear relationship exists between the number of components shared by climate models and how similar the simulations are. The resulting similarities in behaviour need to be accounted for in the generation of best-estimate multi-model climate projections. This has led to calls to move beyond equally-weighted multi-model means towards weighted means that take into account both model performance and model independence. Model independence has been defined in terms of performance differences within an ensemble. However, this definition is sensitive to the choice of variable, observational data set, metric, time period, and region, and a performance ranked ensemble has been shown to sometimes perform worse than a"}

This allows for a more detailed investigation into the relative roles of GHG and SLCF emissions in future global and regional climate change, and hence the implications of policy choices. For instance, SSP1-2.6 builds on an assumption of stringent air quality mitigation policy, leading to rapid reductions in particle emissions, while SSP3-7.0 assumes slow improvements, with pollutant emissions over the 21st century comparable to current levels. One limitation of the SSP scenarios used for CMIP6 and in this Report is that they reduce emissions from all the major ozone-depleting substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol (CFCs, halons, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons) uniformly, rather than representing a fuller range of possible high and low emission futures. Hydrofluorocarbon emissions, on the other hand, span a wider range within the SSPs than in the RCPs. The SSP scenarios and previous RCP scenarios are not directly comparable. First, the gas-to-gas compositions differ; for example, the SSP5-8.5 scenario has higher CO2 concentrations but lower methane concentrations compared to RCP8.5. Second, the projected 21st-century trajectories may differ, even if they result in the same radiative forcing by 2100. Third, the overall effective radiative forcing may differ, and tends to be higher for the SSPs compared to RCPs that share the same nominal stratospherictemperature adjusted radiative forcing label. The stratospheric-temperature adjusted radiative forcings of the SSPs and RCPs, however, remain relatively close, at least by 2100. In summary, differences in, for example, CMIP5 RCP8.5 and CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 ESM outputs, are partially due to different scenario characteristics rather than different ESM characteristics only. When investigating various mitigation futures, WGIII goes beyond the core set of SSP scenarios assessed in WGI to consider the characteristics of more than 1000 scenarios. In addition, while staying within the framework of socio-economic development pathways, WGIII also considers various mitigation possibilities through socalled illustrative pathways. These illustrative pathways help to highlight key narratives in the literature concerning various technological, social and behavioral options for mitigation, various timings for implementation, or varying emphasis on different GHG and land use options. Just as with the SSPX-Y scenarios considered in this report, these illustrative pathways can be placed in relation to the matrix of SSP families and approximate radiative forcing levels in 2100. No likelihood is attached to the scenarios assessed in this report, and the feasibility of specific scenarios in relation to current trends is best informed by the WGIII contribution to AR6. In the scenario literature, the plausibility of the high emissions levels underlying scenarios such as RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 has been debated in light of recent developments in the energy sector..

They allow for a more comprehensive assessment of climate drivers and responses than has previously been available, in particular because some of the scenarios time series, e.g., pollutants, emissions or changes in land use and land cover, are more diverse in the SSP scenarios than in the RCPs used in AR5."}

The CO2 concentrations under the SSP1-1.9 scenarios reach approximately 350 ppm after 2150, while those of SSP5-8.5 exceed 2000 ppm CO2 in the longer term. Similarly to the dominant radiative forcing share at each point in time, cumulative GWP-100-weighted GHG emissions happen to be closely correlated with cumulative CO2 emissions, allowing policymakers to make use of the carbon budget concept in a policy context with multi-gas GHG baskets as it exhibits relatively low variation across scenarios with similar cumulative emissions until 2050. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. Box 1.4: The relationships between net zero emissions, temperature outcomes and carbon dioxide removal Article 4 of the Paris Agreement sets an objective to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases. This box addresses the relationship between such a balance and the corresponding evolution of global surface temperature, with or without the deployment of large-scale Carbon Dioxide Removal, using the definitions of net zero CO2 emissions and net zero greenhouse gas emissions of the AR6 Glossary. Net zero CO2 emissions is defined in AR6 as the condition in which anthropogenic CO2 emissions are balanced by anthropogenic CO2 removals over a specified period. Similarly, net zero GHG emissions is the condition in which metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions are balanced by metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG removals over a specified period. The quantification of net zero GHG emissions thus depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to compare emissions of different gases, as well as the time horizon chosen for that metric. Technical notes expanding on these definitions can be found as part of their respective entries in the Annex VII: Glossary. The notes clarify the relation between net zero CO2 and GHG emissions and the concept of carbon and GHG neutrality, and the metric usage set out in the Paris Rulebook. A global net zero level of CO2, or GHG, emissions will be achieved when the sum of anthropogenic emissions and removals across all countries, sectors, sources and sinks reaches zero. Achieving net zero CO2 or GHG emissions globally, at a given time, does not imply that individual entities have to reach net zero emissions at that same point in time, or even at all. Net zero CO2 and net zero GHG emissions differ in their implications for the subsequent evolution of global surface temperature. Net zero CO2 emissions result in approximately stable CO2-induced warming, but overall warming will depend on any further warming contribution of non-CO2 GHGs. The effect of net zero GHG emissions on global surface temperature depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to aggregate emissions and removals of different gases. For GWP100, net zero GHG emissions would generally imply a peak in global surface temperature, followed by a gradual decline (Chapter 7, Section 7.6.2; see also"}

GMST and SST are shown only for data sets which use air temperature over sea ice. Changes from an 18501900 baseline are calculated only for those datasets which have data in at least 80% of years over 18501900. GMST values for each year are calculated as the mean of hemispheric means for the NH and SH, while LSAT and SST values are calculated from hemispheric means weighted according to the proportion of land in the two hemispheres. This may vary from the methods used by individual data set providers in their own reporting. Products which meet all criteria to be included in the final assessment and contribute to the average are shown in italics.

Since AR5, improvements have been made in all aspects of data collection, data curation, data provision and data analysis permitting improved scientific insights. The chapter has also benefitted from the availability of new products from a range of emerging, mainly space- based, observing capabilities and new generations of reanalysis products. However, a number of key challenges still remain which, if addressed, would serve to strengthen future reports.  Development of new techniques and exploitation of existing and new proxy sources may help address challenges around the low temporal resolution of most paleoclimate proxy records, particularly prior to the Common Era, and ambiguities around converting paleoclimate proxy data into estimates of climate-relevant variables. Conversions rely upon important proxy-specific assumptions and biases can be large due to limited accounting of seasonality, non-climatic effects, or the influence of multiple climate variables. These challenges currently limit the ability to ascertain the historical unusualness of recent directly observed climate changes for many indicators.  Improved sharing of historical instrumental and proxy records along with significant efforts at data rescue of presently undigitised records would serve to significantly strengthen many aspects of the present assessment. Longer observational time series help to better understand variability, and any underlying periodicity in climate indicators and climate forcers, especially for components of the climate system where the dominant response is on multi-decadal and longer time scales. Targeted rescue of early marine data records, especially from waters of the tropical oceans and the Southern Ocean could help constrain modes of variability and important teleconnection changes in, for example, the hydrological cycle and patterns of global temperature change.  Contemporary observing systems have limitations in parts of the Earth system with limited accessibility or coverage, for example coastal and shallow ocean, polar regions, marine biosphere, and the deep sea, leading to seasonal-dependency and regional variability in data coverage and uncertainty which serve to limit confidence in the present assessment of changes.  Contradictory lines of evidence exist between observations and models on the relationship between the rates of warming in GMST and GSAT, compounded by limitations in theoretical understanding."}

While CMIP6 models capture the general characteristics of the tropospheric large-scale circulation, systematic biases exist in the mean frequency of atmospheric blocking events, especially in the Euro-Atlantic sector, some of which reduce with increasing model resolution. Human Influence on the Cryosphere It is very likely that anthropogenic forcing, mainly due to greenhouse gas increases, was the main driver of Arctic sea ice loss since the late 1970s. There is new evidence that increases in anthropogenic aerosols have offset part of the greenhouse gas-induced Arctic sea ice loss since the 1950s. In the Arctic, despite large differences in the mean sea ice state, loss of sea ice extent and thickness during recent decades is reproduced in all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. By contrast, global climate models do not generally capture the small observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent during the satellite era, and there is low confidence in attributing the causes of this change. It is very likely that human influence contributed to the observed reductions in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover since 1950. The seasonal cycle in Northern Hemisphere snow cover is better reproduced by CMIP6 than by CMIP5 models. Human influence was very likely the main driver of the recent global, near-universal retreat of glaciers. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades, and there is medium confidence in an anthropogenic contribution to recent overall mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, there is only limited evidence, with medium agreement, of human influence on Antarctic Ice Sheet mass balance through changes in ice discharge. Human Influence on the Ocean It is extremely likely that human influence was the main driver of the ocean heat content increase observed since the 1970s, which extends into the deeper ocean. Since AR5, there is improved consistency between recent observed estimates and model simulations of changes in upper ocean heat content, when accounting for both natural and anthropogenic forcings. Updated observations and model simulations show that warming extends throughout the entire water column, with CMIP6 models simulating 58% of industrial-era heat uptake in the upper layer, 21% in the intermediate layer and 22% in the deep layer. The structure and magnitude of multi-model mean ocean temperature biases have not changed substantially between CMIP5 and CMIP6. It is extremely likely that human influence has contributed to observed near-surface and subsurface oceanic salinity changes since the mid-20th century. The associated pattern of change corresponds to fresh regions becoming fresher and salty regions becoming saltier. Changes to the coincident atmospheric water cycle and oceanatmosphere fluxes are the primary drivers of the observed basin-scale salinity changes. The observed depth-integrated basinscale salinity changes have been attributed to human influence, with CMIP5 and CMIP6 models able to reproduce these patterns only in simulations that include greenhouse gas increases. The basin-scale changes are consistent across models and intensify through the historical period. The structure of the biases in the multi-model mean has not changed substantially between CMIP5 and CMIP6. Combining the attributable contributions from glaciers, ice sheet surface mass balance and thermal expansion, it is very likely that human influence was the main driver of the observed global mean sea level rise since at least 1970. Since the AR5, studies have shown that simulations that exclude anthropogenic greenhouse gases are unable to capture the sea level rise due to thermal expansion during the historical period and that model simulations that include all forcings most closely match observed estimates. It is very likely that human influence was the main driver of the observed global mean thermosteric sea level increase since 1970."}

No changes in Antarctic Circumpolar Current transport or meridional position have been observed. The mean zonal and overturning circulations of the Southern Ocean and the mean overturning circulation of the North Atlantic are broadly reproduced by CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. However, biases are apparent in the modelled circulation strengths and their variability. Human Influence on the Biosphere The main driver of the observed increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 is enhanced fertilization of plant growth by the increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2. However, there is only low confidence that this CO2 fertilization has also been the main driver of observed greening because land management is the dominating factor in some regions. Earth system models simulate globally averaged land carbon sinks within the range of observation-based estimates, but global-scale agreement masks large regional disagreements. It is virtually certain that the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 was the main driver of the observed acidification of the global ocean. The observed increase in CO2 concentration in the subtropical and equatorial North Atlantic since 2000 is likely associated in part with an increase in ocean temperature, a response that is consistent with the expected weakening of the ocean carbon sink with warming. Consistent with AR5 there is medium confidence that deoxygenation in the upper ocean is due in part to human influence. There is high confidence that Earth system models simulate a realistic time evolution of the global mean ocean carbon sink. Human Influence on Modes of Climate Variability It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed trend towards the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode since the 1970s and to the associated strengthening and southward shift of the Southern Hemispheric extratropical jet in austral summer. The influence of ozone forcing on the SAM trend has been small since the early 2000s compared to earlier decades, contributing to a weaker SAM trend observed over 20002019. Climate models reproduce the summertime SAM trend well, with CMIP6 models outperforming CMIP5 models. By contrast, the cause of the Northern Annular Mode trend towards its positive phase since the 1960s and associated northward shifts of Northern Hemispheric extratropical jet and storm track in boreal winter is not well understood. Models reproduce observed spatial features and variance of the SAM and NAM very well. Human influence has not affected the principal tropical modes of interannual climate variability or their associated regional teleconnections beyond the range of internal variability. Further assessment since the AR5 confirms that climate and Earth system models are able to reproduce most aspects of the spatial structure and variance of the El NinoSouthern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole modes. However, despite a slight improvement in CMIP6, some underlying processes are still poorly represented. In the Tropical Atlantic basin, which contains the Atlantic Zonal and Meridional modes, major biases in modelled mean state and variability remain. There is medium confidence that anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols contributed to observed changes in the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability index and associated regional teleconnections since the 1960s, but there is low confidence in the magnitude of this influence There is high confidence that internal variability is the main driver of Pacific Decadal Variability observed since pre-industrial times, despite some modelling evidence for potential human influence. Uncertainties remain in quantification of the human influence on AMV and PDV due to brevity of the observational records, limited model"}

Initially, these methods were applied to detect changes in global surface temperature, and were then extended to other climate variables at different time and spatial scales. These approaches are based on multivariate linear regression and assume that the observed change consists of a linear combination of externally forced signals plus internal variability, which generally holds for large-scale variables. The regressors are the expected space-time response patterns to different climate forcings, and the residuals represent internal variability. Fingerprints are usually estimated from climate model simulations following spatial and temporal averaging. A regression coefficient which is significantly different from zero implies that a detectable change is identified in the observations. When the confidence interval of the regression coefficient includes unity and is inconsistent with zero, the magnitude of the model simulated fingerprints is assessed to be consistent with the observations, implying that the observed changes can be attributed in part to a particular forcing. Variants of linear regression have been used to address uncertainty in the fingerprints due to internal variability as well as the structural model uncertainty. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, observations and model-simulated responses are usually normalized by an estimate of internal variability derived from climate model simulations. This procedure requires an estimate of the inverse covariance matrix of the internal variability, and some approaches have been proposed for more reliable estimation of this. A signal can be spuriously detected due to too small noise, and hence simulated internal variability needs to be evaluated with care. Modelsimulated variability is typically checked through comparing modelled variance from unforced simulations with the observed residual variance using a standard residual consistency test, or an improved one. Imbers et al. tested the sensitivity of detection and attribution results to the different representations of internal variability associated with short-memory and long-memory processes. Their results supported the robustness of previous detection and attribution statements for the global mean temperature change but they also recommended the use of a wider variety of robustness tests. Some recent studies focused on the improved estimation of the scaling factor and its confidence interval. Hannart et al. describe an inference procedure for scaling factors which avoids making the assumption that model error and internal variability have the same covariance structure. An integrated approach to optimal fingerprinting was further suggested in which all uncertainty sources are treated in one statistical model without a preliminary dimension reduction step. Katzfuss et al. introduced a similar integrated approach based on a Bayesian model averaging. On the other hand, DelSole et al. suggested a bootstrap method to better estimate the confidence intervals of scaling factors even in a weak-signal regime. It is notable that some studies do not optimise fingerprints, as uncertainty in the covariance introduces a further layer of complexity, but results in only a limited improvement in detection. Another fingerprinting approach uses pattern similarity between observations and fingerprints, in which the leading empirical orthogonal function obtained from the time-evolving multi-model forced simulation is usually defined as a fingerprint. Observations and model simulations are then projected onto the fingerprint to measure the degree of spatial pattern similarity with the expected physical response to a given forcing. This projection provides the signal time series, which is in turn tested against internal variability, as estimated from long control simulations. As a way to extend this pattern-based approach to a high-dimensional detection variable at daily timescales, Sippel et al. proposed using the relationship pattern with a global climate change metric as a fingerprint. To solve the high-dimensional regression problem which makes regression coefficients not well constrained, they incorporated a statistical learning technique based on a regularized linear regression, which optimizes a global warming signal by giving lower weight to regions with large internal variability."}

The method was further developed by Ribes et al., who applied it to narrow the uncertainty range in the estimated human-induced warming. Hannart and Naveau, on the other hand, extended the application of standard causal theory to the context of detection and attribution by converting a time series into an event, and calculating the probability of causation, an approach which maximizes the causal evidence associated with the forcing. On the other hand, Schurer et al. employed a Bayesian framework to explicitly consider climate modelling uncertainty in the optimal regression method. Application of these approaches to attribution of large-scale temperature changes supports the dominant anthropogenic contribution to the observed global warming. Climate change signals can vary with time and discriminant analysis has been used to obtain more accurate estimates of time-varying signals, and has been applied to different variables such as seasonal temperatures and the South Asian monsoon. The same approach was applied to separate aerosol forcing responses from other forcings and results using climate model output indicated that detectability of the aerosol response is maximised by using a combination of temperature and precipitation data. Paeth et al. introduced a detection and attribution method applicable for multiple variables based on a discriminant analysis and a Bayesian classification method. Finally, a systematic approach has been proposed to translating quantitative analysis into a description of confidence in the detection and attribution of a climate response to anthropogenic drivers. Overall, these new fingerprinting and other probabilistic methods for detection and attribution as well as efforts to better incorporate the associated uncertainties have addressed a number of shortcomings in previously applied detection and attribution techniques. They further strengthen the confidence in attribution of observed large-scale changes to a combination of external forcings as assessed in the following sections. 3.3 Human Influence on the Atmosphere and Surface 3.3.1 Temperature 3.3.1.1 Surface Temperature Surface temperature change is the aspect of climate in which the climate research community has had most confidence over past IPCC Assessment Reports. This confidence comes from the availability of longer observational records compared to other indicators, a large response to anthropogenic forcing compared to variability in the global mean, and a strong theoretical understanding of the key thermodynamics driving its changes. AR5 assessed that it was extremely likely that human activities had caused more than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2010, and virtually certain that internal variability alone could not account for the observed global warming since 1951. The AR5 also assessed with very high confidence that climate models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over 1850-2011 and with high confidence that models reproduce global and Northern Hemisphere temperature variability on a wide range of time scales. This section assesses the performance of the new generation CMIP6 models in simulating the patterns, trends, and variability of surface temperature, and the evidence from detection and attribution studies of human influence on large-scale changes in surface temperature.

Since AR5, new work has characterized the contributions of variability in different ocean areas to SST variability, with tropical modes of variability like ENSO dominant on time scales of 5 to 10 years, while longer time scales see the variance maxima move poleward to the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern oceans. There may, however, be sizeable, two-way interdependencies between ENSO and sea surface temperature variability in different basins, and ENSOs influence on global surface temperature variability may not be confined only to decadal timescales. Studies based on large ensembles of 20th and 21st century climate change simulations confirm that internal variability has a substantial influence on global warming trends over periods shorter than 30-40 years. Although the equatorial Pacific seems to be the main source of internal variability on decadal timescales, Brown et al. linked diversity in modelled oceanic convection, sea ice, and energy budget in highlatitude regions to overall diversity in modelled internal variability. Interest in internal variability since publication of the AR5 stems in part from its importance in understanding the slower global surface temperature warming over the early 21st century. Evidence coming mostly from paleo studies is mixed on whether CMIP5 models underestimate decadal and multi-decadal variability in global mean temperature. Schurer et al. found good agreement between internal variability derived from paleo reconstructions, estimated as the fraction of variance that is not explained by forced responses, and modelled variability, although the subset of CMIP5 models they used may have been associated with larger variability than the full CMIP5 ensemble. PAGES 2k Consortium found that the largest 51-year trends in both reconstructions of global mean temperature and fully forced climate simulations over the period 850 to 1850 were almost identical. Zhu et al. showed agreement in the modelled and reconstructed temporal spectrum of global surface temperatures on annual to multi-millennial timescales. However, they suggest that decadal-to-centennial variability is partly forced by slow orbital changes that predate the last millennium. This is consistent with Gebbie and Huybers, who showed that the deep ocean has been out of equilibrium over that period. Laepple and Huybers found good agreement between modelled and proxy-derived decadal ocean temperature variability, but underestimates of variance by models by at least a factor of ten at centennial timescales because models underestimate the difference between the warm and cold periods of the last millennium. Parsons et al. found that some CMIP6 models exhibit much higher multidecadal variability in GSAT than CMIP5 models, with indications that variability in these models is also higher than that from proxy reconstructions. CMIP6 models may not share the underestimation by CMIP5 models of variability in decadal to multidecadal modes of variability, such as Pacific decadal variability and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability but this assessment is limited by the small number of available studies. For the SH, Hegerl et al. found an instance of internal variability in the early 20th century larger than that modelled, but indicated that could be an observational issue. Friedman et al. found biases in interhemispheric SST contrast in some models that may be consistent with underestimated cooling after early-20th century eruptions or underestimated Pacific decadal variability, but could also be due to an imperfect separation between internal variability and forced signal in the observations. Figure 3.2c, updated from PAGES 2k Consortium, compares modelled temperatures to reconstructions over the last millennium. It indicates that models reproduce the observed variability well, at least for the timescales between 20 and 50 years that paleo reconstructions typically resolve and that the figure represents. In summary, decadal GMST variability simulated in CMIP6 models spans the range of residual decadal variability in large-scale reconstructions. In addition, new literature suggests that anthropogenic forcing itself may locally increase or decrease variability in surface temperatures. Those studies imply limitations in the use of pre-industrial control simulations to quantify the role of unforced variability over the historical period. Some recent attribution studies have estimated variability from ensembles of forced simulations instead, which would be expected to resolve any such changes in variability.

The IPCC SR1.5 reached the same conclusion for 2017 relative to 1850-1900 based on anthropogenic warming and associated uncertainties calculated using the method of Haustein et al.. Moreover, the improved understanding of the causes of the apparent slowdown in warming over the beginning of the 21st century and the difference in simulated and observed warming trends over this period further improve our confidence in the assessment of the dominant anthropogenic contribution to observed warming. In deriving our assessments, these considerations are balanced against new literature that raises questions about the ability of some models to simulate variability in surface temperatures over a range of time scales, and the finding that some CMIP6 models exhibit substantially higher multidecadal internal variability than that seen in CMIP5, which remains to be fully understood. Further, uncertainties in simulated aerosol-cloud interactions are still large, resulting in very diverse spatial responses of different climate models to aerosol forcing and differences in the historical global mean temperature evolution and in diagnosed cooling attributable to aerosol. Moreover, like previous generations of coupled model simulations, historical and single forcing CMIP6 simulations follow a common experimental design and are thus all driven by the same common set of forcings, even though these forcings are uncertain. Hence, forcing uncertainty is not directly accounted for in most of the attribution and model evaluation studies assessed here, although this limitation can to some extent be addressed by comparing with previous generation multi-model ensembles or individual model studies using different sets of forcings. The IPCC SR1.5 best estimate and likely range of anthropogenic attributable GMST warming was 1.00.2C in 2017 with respect to the period 1850-1900. Here, the best estimate is expressed in terms of GSAT and is calculated as the average of the three estimates shown in Figure 3.9, yielding a value of 1.07C. Ranges for attributable GSAT warming are derived by finding the smallest ranges with a precision of 0.1C which span all of the 5-95% ranges from the attribution studies shown in Figure 3.9. These ranges are then assessed as likely rather than very likely because the studies may underestimate the importance of the structural limitations of climate models, which probably do not represent all possible sources of internal variability; use too simple climate models, which may underestimate the role of internal variability; or underestimate model uncertainty, especially when using model ensembles of limited size and inter-dependent models, for example through common errors in forcings across models, as discussed above. This leads to a likely range for anthropogenic attributable warming in 2010-2019 relative to 1850-1900 of 0.8 to 1.3C in terms of GSAT. Consequently, that range encompasses the best estimate and very likely range of observed GSAT warming of 1.06 C over the same period. There is medium confidence that the best estimate and likely ranges of attributable warming expressed in terms of GMST are equal to those for GSAT. Repeating the process for other time periods leads to the best estimates and likely ranges listed in Table 3.1. GSAT change attributable to natural forcings is 0.1 to 0.1C. The likely range of GSAT warming attributable to greenhouse gases is assessed in the same way to be 1.0 to 2.0C while the GSAT change attributable to aerosols, ozone and land-use change is 0.8 to 0.0C. Progress in attribution techniques allows the important advance of attributing observed surface temperature warming since 1850-1900, instead of since 1951 as was done in the AR5. Table 3.1: Estimates of warming in GSAT attributable to human influence for different periods in C, all relative to the 1850-1900 base period.

All the updated products now available consistently find stronger positive trends for 1998-2012 than those assessed in AR5. Simmons et al. reported that the 1998-2012 GMST trends in the updated observational and reanalysis data sets available at that time range from 0.06 C to 0.14C per decade, compared with the 0.05 C per decade on average as reported in AR5, whilst the latest data products reported in Chapter 2 Table 2.4 show GMST or global mean near-surface air temperature trends over that period ranging from 0.12C to 0.14C per decade. The lowest trend in Simmons et al. is from HadCRUT4, now superseded by HadCRUT5, which shows a trend of 0.12 oC per decade. The upward revision is mainly due to improved sea surface temperature data sets and infilling of surface temperature in locations with missing records in observational products, mainly in the Arctic. With these updates, all the observed trends assessed here lie within the 10th-90th percentile range of the simulated trends in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations. This result is insensitive to whether model GSAT or GMST is used, and to whether or not masking with the observational data coverage is applied. Therefore, the observed 1998-2012 trend is consistent with both the CMIP5 or CMIP6 multi-model ensemble of trends over the same period. Internal variability All the observation-based GMST and GSAT trends are lower than the multi-model mean GMST and GSAT trends of both CMIP5 and CMIP6 for 1998-2012. This suggests a possible cooling contribution from internal variability during this period. This is supported by initialized decadal hindcasts, which account for the phase of the multidecadal modes of variability, and which better reproduce observed global mean SST and GSAT trends than uninitialized historical simulations. Studies since AR5 identify Pacific Decadal Variability as the leading mode of variability associated with unforced decadal GSAT fluctuations, with additional influence from Atlantic Multidecadal Variability. PDV transitioned from positive to negative phases during the slow warming period. Model ensemble members that capture the observed slower decadal warming under transient forcing, and time segments of model simulations that show decadal GSAT decreases under fixed radiative forcing, also feature negative PDV trends, suggesting the influence of PDV. This is confirmed by statistical models with the PDV-GSAT relationship estimated from observations and model simulations, selected ensemble members and time segments from model simulations where PDV by chance evolves in phase with observations over the slow warming period, and coupled model experiments in which PDV evolution is constrained to follow the observations. Part of the PDV trend may be driven by anthropogenic aerosols; however, this result is model-dependent, and internally-driven PDV dominates the forced PDV signal in the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble. It is also notable that there is large uncertainty in the magnitude of the PDV influence on GSAT across models and among the studies cited above. In addition to PDV, contributions to the reduced warming trend from wintertime Northern Hemisphere atmospheric internal variability, particularly associated with a trend towards the negative phase of the Northern Annular Mode/North Atlantic Oscillation or the Cold Ocean-Warm Land pattern have been suggested, leading to regional continental cooling over a large part of Eurasia and North America."}

However, observed trends in seasonality depend on data set used, and Marvel et al. found that observed changes in the annual cycle phase are consistent with model estimates of forced changes. These phase changes are mainly characterized by earlier onset of the wet season on the equatorward flanks of the extratropical storm tracks, particularly in the SH. Box 8.2 assesses regional changes in water cycle seasonality. The CMIP5 models have also been shown to adequately simulate the mean and interannual variability of the global monsoon, but maintain the double ITCZ bias in the equatorial Pacific. Despite the ITCZ bias, CMIP5 models have been used to detect in reanalysis a southward shift in the ITCZ prior to 1975, followed by a northward shift in the ITCZ after 1975, in response to forced changes in inter-hemispheric temperature contrast. CMIP5 models perform better than CMIP3 models, in particular regarding the global monsoon domain and intensity. In observations at time scales less than a day intermittent rainfall fluctuations dominate variability, but CMIP5 models systematically underestimate them. Moreover, as noted in previous generation models, CMIP5 models produce rainfall too early in the day. Also, models overpredict precipitation frequency but have weaker intensity, although comparison with observed data sets is complex as the latter present large differences in intensity among them. Regarding trends in precipitation intensity, models have also been shown to reproduce the compensation between increasing heavy precipitation and decreasing light to moderate rainfall, a characteristic found in the observational record. Regional performance is further assessed in Chapters 8 and the Atlas, while precipitation extremes are considered in Chapter 11. The simulation of annual mean rainfall patterns in the CMIP6 models reveals minor improvements compared to those of CMIP5 models. The persistent biases include the double ITCZ in the tropical Pacific and the southward-shifted ITCZ in the equatorial Atlantic, which have been linked to the meridional pattern of SST bias and the reduced sensitivity of precipitation to local SST. Tian and Dong also found that all three generations of CMIP models share similar systematic annual mean precipitation errors in the tropics, but that the double ITCZ bias is slightly reduced in CMIP6 models in comparison to CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. They also found some improvement in the overly intense Indian ocean ITCZ and the too dry South American continent except over the Andes. Fiedler et al. identified improvements in the tropical mean spatial correlations and root mean square error of the climatology as well as in the day-to-day variability, but found little change across CMIP phases in the double ITCZ bias and diurnal cycle. The CMIP6 models reproduce better the domain and intensity of the global monsoon. Moreover, CMIP6 models better represent the storm tracks, thereby reducing the precipitation biases in the North Atlantic and midlatitudes of the SH. As a result, pattern correlations between simulated and observed annual mean precipitation range between 0.80 and 0.92 for CMIP6, compared to a range of 0.79 to 0.88 for CMIP5. This relative improvement may be related to increased model resolution, as found when comparing biases in the mean of the HighResMIP models with the mean of the corresponding lower-resolution versions of the same models, particularly in the tropics and extratropical storm tracks. In agreement, a recent study using several coupled models showed that increasing the atmospheric resolution leads to a strong decrease in the precipitation bias in the tropical Atlantic ITCZ. Based on these results we assess that despite some improvements, CMIP6 models still have deficiencies in simulating precipitation patterns, particularly over the tropical ocean."}

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. For the SH extratropics, Solman and Orlanski found that the observed summertime rainfall increase over high latitudes and decrease over mid-latitudes over the period 1979-2010 are quasi-zonally symmetric and related to changes in eddy activity. The latter were in turn found to be associated with the poleward shift of the westerlies due mostly to ozone depletion. Positive rainfall trends in the subtropics, particularly over southeastern South America and northern and central Australia, have been also attributed to stratospheric ozone depletion and greenhouse gases. During austral winter, wetting at high latitudes and drying at mid-latitudes are not zonally homogenous, due to both changes in eddy activity and increased lower troposphere humidity. Solman and Orlanski associated these climate changes with increases in greenhouse gas concentration levels. Recently, Blazquez and Solman have shown that CMIP5 models represent very well the dynamical forcing and the frequency of frontal precipitation in the SH winter extratropics, but the amount of precipitation due to fronts is overestimated. Chapters 10 and 11 validate in more detail the simulation of fronts in climate models. Over the ocean, observations show coherent large-scale patterns of fresh ocean regions becoming fresher and salty ocean regions saltier across the globe, which has been related through modelling studies to changes in precipitation minus evaporation and is consistent with the wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier paradigm. Overall, studies published since AR5 provide further evidence of an anthropogenic influence on precipitation, and therefore we now assess that it is likely that human influence has contributed to large-scale precipitation changes observed since the mid-20th century. New attribution studies strengthen previous findings of a detectable increase in mid to high latitude land precipitation over the NH. There is medium confidence that human influence has contributed to a strengthening of the zonal mean wet tropics-dry subtropics contrast, and that tropical rainfall changes follow the wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier paradigm. There is also medium confidence that ozone depletion has increased precipitation over the southern high latitudes and decreased it over southern midlatitudes during austral summer. Owing to observational uncertainties and inconsistent results between studies, we conclude that there is low confidence in the attribution of changes in the seasonality of precipitation. 3.3.2.3 Streamflow Streamflow is to-date the only variable of the terrestrial water cycle with enough in-situ observations to allow for detection and attribution analysis at continental to global scales. Based on evidence from a few formal detection and attribution studies, particularly on the timing of peak streamflow, and the qualitative evaluation of studies reporting on observed and simulated trends, AR5 concluded that there is medium confidence that anthropogenic influence on climate has affected streamflow in some middle and high latitude regions. AR5 also noted that observational uncertainties are large and that often only a limited number of models were considered. Section 2.3.1.3.6 assesses that there have not been significant trends in global average streamflow over the last century, though regional trends have been observed, driven in part by internal variability.

Trends since the 1980s in in-situ and satellite observations and reanalyses exhibit strengthening of the Pacific Walker circulation and SST gradient. AMIP simulations reproduce this strengthening, indicating a dominant role of SST changes. However, all reanalysis trends lie outside the 5-95% range of simulated CMIP6 historical Walker circulation trends over this period, consistent with CMIP5 results. This may be in part caused by the underestimation of the PDV magnitude especially in CMIP5 models, but also suggests a potential error in simulating the forced changes of the Walker circulation. Specifically, anthropogenic and volcanic aerosol changes over this period may have driven a strengthening. This aerosol influence may be indirect via Atlantic Multidecadal Variability through inter-basin teleconnections, which may be underestimated in models due to SST biases in the equatorial Atlantic. Note also the large uncertainty in aerosol influence on the Walker circulation, which is also seen in CMIP6. Paleoclimate data from the Pliocene epoch suggest that there was a reduction in the zonal SST gradient in the tropical Pacific under a similar CO2 concentration as today. Tierney et al. found that this weaker gradient compared to pre-industrial, which suggests a weaker Walker circulation, is captured by climate models under Pliocene CO2 levels, in agreement with the CMIP6 response to greenhouse gas forcing, though the magnitude of this effect varies strongly between models. Summary It is likely that human influence has contributed to the poleward expansion of the zonal mean Hadley cell in the SH since the 1980s. This assessment is supported by studies since AR5, which consistently find human influence from greenhouse gas increases on the expansion, with additional influence from ozone depletion in austral summer. For the strong ozone depletion period of 1981-2000, human influence is detectable in the summertime poleward expansion in the SH. By contrast, there is medium confidence that the expansion of the zonal mean Hadley cell in the NH is within the range of internal variability, with contributions from PDV and other internal variability. The causes of the observed strengthening of the Pacific Walker circulation over the 1980-2014 period are not well understood, since the observed strengthening trend is outside the range of variability simulated in the coupled models. Large observational uncertainty, lack of understanding of the mechanism underlying the poleward Hadley cell expansion, and contradicting theories on the greenhouse gas influence and uncertainty in the aerosol influence on the Walker circulation strength, limit confidence in these assessments.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. 3.3.3.2 Global Monsoon Monsoons are seasonal transitions of regimes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation with the annual cycle of solar insolation, in association with redistribution of moist static energy. The global monsoon can be defined to encompasses all monsoon systems based on precipitation contrast in the solstice seasons. All regional monsoons are intimately connected to the global tropical atmospheric overturning by mass, momentum and energy budgets. Assessments of regional monsoon changes are made in Section 8.3.2.4 and Sections 10.4.2.1 and 10.6.3. AR5 assessed that CMIP5 models simulated monsoons better than CMIP3 models but that biases remained in domains and intensity. There were no detection and attribution assessment statements on the decreasing trend of global monsoon precipitation over land from the 1950s to the 1980s or the increasing trend of global monsoon precipitation afterwards. In the paleoclimate context, it was determined with high confidence that orbital forcing produces strong interhemispheric rainfall variability evident in multiple types of proxies. Paleoclimate proxy evidence shows that the global monsoon has varied with orbital forcing and greenhouse gases. These large-magnitude intensifications and weakenings in the global monsoon involved in some cases orders-of-magnitude changes in precipitation locally. Paleoclimate modelling and limited data from past climate states with high CO2 suggest that precipitation intensifies in the monsoon domain under elevated greenhouse gases, providing context for present and future trends. In model simulations of the mid-Pliocene, when globally averaged temperature was higher than present day, precipitation was larger in West African and South and East Asian monsoons than under pre-industrial conditions, consistent with proxy evidence. Prescott et al. and Zhang et al. find an important role for orbital forcing and CO2 in the mid-Pliocene monsoon expansion and intensification. Models are also able to capture interhemispherically contrasting monsoon changes in the Last Interglacial in response to orbital forcing and greenhouse gases, with wetter West African and Asian monsoons and a drier South American monsoon as seen in proxies. In overall agreement with proxy evidence, a model with transient forcing simulates wetting and drying respectively of the Southern and NH monsoons during the last deglaciation, with an important contribution from Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slowdown. During the mid-Holocene, global monsoons were stronger especially in the NH with an expansion of the West African monsoon domain in response to orbital forcing. Simulations of the mid-Holocene with CMIP5 and CMIP6 models qualitatively capture the stronger NH monsoon, mainly driven by atmospheric circulation changes. However, the models underestimate the monsoon expansion found in proxy reconstructions, which may be linked to mean biases in the monsoon domain and may be improved by imposing vegetation and dust changes. The models simulate the weaker SH monsoon during the mid-Holocene, consistent with proxy evidence. These studies indicate that models can qualitatively reproduce past global monsoon changes seen in proxies, though issues remain in quantitatively reproducing proxy observations. Studies of last millennium simulations show that simulated"}

Compared to greenhouse gas and solar variations, volcanic forcing is more effective in changing the global monsoon precipitation over the last millennium. Reproducing monsoons in terms of domain, precipitation amount, and timings of onset and retreat over the historical period also remains difficult. While CMIP5 historical simulations correctly capture global monsoon domains and intensity based on summer and winter precipitation differences, they underestimate the extent and intensity of East Asian and North American monsoons while overestimating them over the tropical western North Pacific. Wang et al. reported that CMIP6 models simulate the global monsoon domain and precipitation better, albeit with biases in annual mean precipitation and the timings of onset and withdrawal of the SH monsoon. Notable inter-model differences were identified in CMIP5, with the multi-model ensemble mean outperforming individual models. Common biases were identified across CMIP5 models in moist static energy and upper-tropospheric temperature associated with the South Asian summer monsoon, which may arise from overly smoothed model topography. However, in atmospheric models with increasing resolution approaching 20 km, improvements in monsoon precipitation are not universal across regions and models, and overall improvements are unclear. In instrumental records, global summer monsoon precipitation intensity decreased from the 1950s to 1980s, followed by an increase, arising mainly from variations in Northern Hemispheric land monsoons. A CMIP5 multi-model study by Zhang et al. found that observed 1951-2004 trends of the global and NH summer land monsoon precipitation intensity are well captured by historical simulations, and CMIP6 models show similar results for global land summer monsoon precipitation. However, the 1960s peak in the NH summer monsoon circulation is outside the 5th-95th percentile range of CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations for two out of three reanalyses. Modelling studies show that greenhouse gas increases act to enhance NH summer monsoon precipitation intensity. Since the mid-20th century, however, modelling studies show that this effect was overwhelmed by the influence of anthropogenic aerosols in CMIP5 and in CMIP6. Weakening of the monsoon circulation and reduction of moisture availability are important in this aerosol influence. Besides these human influences, the global monsoon is sensitive to internal variability and natural forcing including ENSO and volcanic aerosols on interannual time scales and PDV and AMV on decadal to multidecadal time scales; though AMV in the 20th century may have been partly driven by aerosols, see Section 3.7.7. Indeed, AMIP simulations better reproduce the observed multidecadal variations of the global monsoon precipitation and circulation. Zhang et al. find that the multi-model ensemble mean trend of global land monsoon precipitation in historical simulations, dominated by anthropogenic aerosol forcing contributions, emerges out of the 90% range of internally-driven trends in preindustrial control simulations. However, it should be noted that CMIP5 models tend to underrepresent the PDV magnitude, suggesting potential overconfidence on the detection of the forced signal. An observed enhancement in global summer monsoon precipitation since the 1980s is accompanied by an intensification of the NH summer monsoon circulation. These trends appear to be at the extreme of the range of the CMIP6 historical simulation ensemble but well captured by AMIP simulations. While the precipitation increase is consistent with greenhouse gas forcing, the circulation intensification is opposite to the simulated response to greenhouse gas forcing, and these enhancements have been attributed to PDV and AMV. In summary, while greenhouse gas increases acted to enhance the global land monsoon precipitation over the 20th century, consistent with projected future enhancement, this tendency was overwhelmed by anthropogenic aerosols from the 1950s to the 1980s, which contributed to weakening of global land summer monsoon precipitation intensity for this period. There is medium confidence that the intensification of global monsoon precipitation and NH summer"}

These assessments are supported respectively by multi-model detection and attribution studies which find an important role for anthropogenic aerosols in the weakening trend, and studies that identify a role for AMV and PDV in inducing the NH summer monsoon circulation enhancement since the 1980s. Supported by multi-model simulations that are qualitatively consistent with proxy evidence, there is high confidence that orbital forcing contributed to stronger NH monsoon precipitation in the mid-Pliocene and mid-Holocene than pre-industrial. While CMIP5 models can capture the domain and precipitation intensity of the global monsoon, biases remain in their regional representations, and they are unsuccessful in quantitatively reproducing changes in paleo reconstructions. CMIP6 models reproduce the domain and precipitation intensity of the global monsoon observed over the instrumental period better than CMIP5 models. However, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models fail to fully capture the variations of the NH summer monsoon circulation, but there is low confidence to this assessment due to a lack of evidence in the literature.

Blocking refers to long-lived, stationary high-pressure systems that are often associated with a poleward displacement of the jet, causing cold spells in winter and heat waves in summer. Sections 2.3.1.4.3, 8.3.2.7, and 11.7.2 discuss these features in more detail. AR5 concluded that models were able to capture the general characteristics of extratropical cyclones and storm tracks, although it also noted that most models underestimated cyclone intensity, that biases in cyclone frequency were linked to biases in sea surface temperatures, and that resolution can play a significant role in the quality of the simulation of storms. Similarly, AR5 found with high confidence that simulation of blocking was improved due to increases in resolution. AR5 did not specifically assess changes in Southern-Hemisphere storm track characteristics or blocking. Since AR5, new research using CMIP5 and CMIP6 models has confirmed that increasing the model resolution improves the simulation of cyclones and blocking in all seasons albeit with some exceptions and caveats. New research also finds that model performance with respect to the simulation of cyclones and that of blocking events are correlated, suggesting biases in both are aspects"}

The recent Arctic sea ice loss during summer is unprecedented since 1850, but as in AR5 and SROCC there remains only medium confidence that the recent reduction is unique during at least past 1000 years due to sparse observations. CMIP5 models also simulate NH sea ice loss over the satellite era but with large differences among models. The envelope of simulated ice loss across model simulations encompasses the observed change, although observations fall near the low end of the CMIP5 and CMIP6 distributions of trends. CMIP6 models on average better capture the observed Arctic sea ice decline, albeit with large inter-model spread. Notz et al. found that CMIP6 models better reproduce the sensitivity of Arctic sea ice area to CO2 emissions and global warming than earlier CMIP models although the models underestimation of this sensitivity remains. Davy and Outten also found that CMIP6 models can simulate the seasonal cycle of Arctic sea ice extent and volume better than CMIP5 models. For the assessment of physical processes associated with changes in Arctic sea ice, see Section 9.3.1.1. Since AR5, there have been several new detection and attribution studies on Arctic sea ice. While the attribution literature has mostly used sea ice extent, it is closely proportional to sea ice area, which is assessed in Chapters 2 and 9 and shown in Figures 3.20 and 3.21. Kirchmeier-Young et al. compared the observed time series of the September SIE over the period 1979-2012 with those from different large ensemble simulations which provide a robust sampling of internal climate variability using an optimal fingerprinting technique. They detected anthropogenic signals which were separable from the response to natural forcing due to solar irradiance variations and volcanic aerosol, supporting previous findings. Using selected CMIP5 models and three independently derived sets of observations, Mueller et al. detected fingerprints from greenhouse gases, natural, and other anthropogenic forcings simultaneously in the September Arctic SIE over the period 1953-2012. They further showed that about a quarter of the greenhouse gas induced decrease in SIE has been offset by an increase due to other anthropogenic forcing. Similarly, Gagne et al. suggested that the observed increase in Arctic sea ice concentration over the 1950-1975 period was primarily due to the cooling contribution of anthropogenic aerosols forcing based on single model simulations. Gagne et al. identified a detectable increase in Arctic SIE in response to volcanic eruptions using CMIP5 models and four observational datasets. Polvani et al. suggested that ozone depleting substances played a substantial role in the Arctic sea ice loss over the 1955-2005 period. Differences in sea ice loss among the models have been attributed to a number of factors. These factors include the late 20th century simulated sea ice state, the magnitude of changing ocean heat transport, and the rate of global warming. Sea ice thermodynamic considerations indicate that the magnitude of sea ice variability and loss depends on ice thickness and hence the climatology simulated by different models may influence their projections of change, as indicated by the regression lines in Figure 3.20. An important consideration in comparing Arctic sea ice loss in models and observations is the role of internal variability. Using ensemble simulations from a single model, Kay et al. suggested that internal variability could account for about half of the observed September ice loss. More recently, large ensemble simulations have been performed with many more ensemble members. These enable a more robust characterization of internal variability in the presence of forced anthropogenic change. Using such large ensembles, some studies discussed the influence of internal variability on Arctic sea ice trends. Song et al. also compared the trends in the forced and unforced simulations using multiple climate models and found that internal variability explains about 40% of the observed September sea ice melting trend, supporting previous studies. Based on the large ensembles of CESM1 and CanESM2, September Arctic sea ice extent variance first increases and then decreases as SIE declines from its pre-industrial value consistent with previous work, but neither study found a strong sensitivity of detection and attribution results to the change in variability. Further work has indicated that internally-driven summer atmospheric circulation trends with enhanced atmospheric ridges over"}

A fingerprint analysis using the CESM large ensemble suggests that this internal variability accounts for 40-50% of the observed September Arctic sea ice decline. Internally-generated decadal tropical variability and associated atmospheric teleconnections were suggested to have contributed to the changing atmospheric circulation in the Arctic and the associated rapid sea ice decline from 2000 to 2014. Some recent studies evaluated the human contribution to recent record minimum SIE events in the Arctic. Analysing CMIP5 simulations, Zhang and Knutson found that the observed 2012 record low in September Arctic SIE is inconsistent with internal climate variability alone. Based on several large ensembles, Kirchmeier-Young et al. concluded that the observed 2012 SIE minimum cannot be reproduced in a simulation excluding human influence. Fuckar et al. showed that climate change contributed to the record low March Arctic SIE in 2015, which was accompanied by the record minimum SIE in the Sea of Okhotsk. Based on the new attribution studies since AR5, we conclude that it is very likely that anthropogenic forcing mainly due to greenhouse gas increases was the main driver of Arctic sea ice loss since 1979. Increases in anthropogenic aerosols have offset part of the greenhouse gas induced Arctic sea ice loss since the 1950s. Despite large differences in the mean sea ice state in the Arctic, Arctic sea ice loss is captured by all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Nonetheless, large inter-model differences in the Arctic sea ice decline remain, limiting our ability to quantify forced changes and internal variability contributions.

Results remain essentially the same when using sea ice extent. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. 3.4.1.2 Antarctic Sea Ice AR5 concluded that there is low confidence in the attribution of the observed increase in Antarctic SIE since 1979 due to the limited understanding of the external forcing contribution as well as the role of internal variability. Based on a difference between the first and last decades, Antarctic sea ice cover exhibited a small increase in summer and winter over the 1979-2017 period. However, these changes are not statistically significant and starting in late 2016, anomalously low sea ice area has been observed. The mean hemispheric sea ice changes result from much larger, but partially compensating, regional changes with increases in the western Ross Sea and Weddell Sea and declines in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas. Observed regional trends have been particularly large in austral autumn. Starting in austral spring of 2016, the ice extent decreased strongly and has since remained anomalously low. This decrease has been associated with anomalous atmospheric conditions associated with teleconnections from warming in the eastern Indian Ocean and a negative Southern Annular Mode. A decadal-scale warming of the near-surface ocean that resulted from strengthened westerlies may also have contributed to and helped to sustain the sea ice loss. Before satellites and on even longer time scales, very limited observational data and proxy coverage leads to low confidence in all"}

CMIP5 climate models generally simulate Antarctic sea ice loss over the satellite era since 1979 in contrast to the observed change, and CMIP6 models also simulate Antarctic ice loss. A number of studies have suggested that this discrepancy may be in part due to the role of internal variability in the observed change, including teleconnections associated with tropical Pacific variability and changing surface conditions resulting from multi-decadal ocean circulation variations. However, when the spatial pattern is considered, trends in the summer and autumn appear outside the range of internal variability. This suggests that the models may exhibit an unrealistic simulation of the Antarctic sea ice forced response or the internal variability of the system. Discrepancies among the models in simulated sea ice variability, the sea ice climatological state, upper ocean temperature trends, SH westerly wind trends, or the sea ice response to Southern Annular Mode variations may all play some role in explaining these differences with the observed trends. Increased fresh water fluxes caused by mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet have been suggested as a possible mechanism driving the multidecadal Antarctic sea ice expansion but there is a lack of consensus on this mechanisms impacts. A recent study based on decadal predictability suggests that initializing the state of the Antarctic bottom water cell can reproduce the observed Antarctic sea ice increase, consistent with the suggestion that multidecadal variability associated with variations in deep convection has contributed to the observed increase in Antarctic sea ice since 1979. There have been several studies which aimed to identify causes of the observed Antarctic SIE changes. Gagne et al. assessed the consistency of observed and simulated changes in Antarctic SIE for an extended period using recovered satellite-based estimates, and found that the observed trends since the mid1960s are not inconsistent with model simulated trends. Studies based on the satellite period also indicate that the observed trends are largely within the range of simulated internal variability. A few distinct factors that led to the weak signal-to-noise ratio in Antarctic SIE trends have been further identified, which include large multi-decadal variability, the short observational record, and the limited model performance at representing the complex Antarctic climate system as discussed above. The short period of comprehensive satellite observations, beginning in 1979, makes it challenging to set the observed increase between 1979 and 2015, or the subsequent decrease, in a long-term context, and to assess whether the difference in trend between observations and models, which mostly simulate long-term decreases, is systematic or a rare expression of internal variability on decadal-to-multidecadal timescales. In conclusion, the observed small increase in Antarctic sea ice extent during the satellite era is not generally captured by global climate models, and there is low confidence in attributing the causes of the change.

AR5 assessed that anthropogenic influence had likely contributed to the retreat of glaciers observed since the 1960s, based on a high level of scientific understanding and robust estimates of observed mass loss, internal variability, and glacier response to climatic drivers. SROCC concluded that atmospheric warming was very likely the primary driver of glacier recession. Simulations of glacier mass changes under climate change rely on glacier models driven by climate model output, often in collaborative research efforts such as GlacierMIP. The GlacierMIP project is a systematic coordinated modelling effort designed to further understanding of glacier loss using global models. While the low resolution and remaining biases of climate model-derived boundary forcing data is a limitation, the release of the Randolph Glacier Inventory has supported more sophisticated, systematic and comprehensive modelling of glaciers worldwide. A regional study considering 85 NH glacier systems concluded that there is a discernible human influence on glacier mass balance, with glacier model simulations driven by CMIP5 historical and greenhouse gas-only simulations showing a glacier mass loss, whereas those driven by natural-only forced simulations showed a net glacier growth. In addition, a study of the role of climate change in glacier retreat using a simple mass-balance model for 37 glaciers worldwide, concluded that observed length changes would not have occurred without anthropogenic climate change, with observed length variations exceeding those associated with internal variability by several standard deviations in many cases. Roe et al. used the same model to estimate that at least 85% of cumulative glacier mass loss since 1850 is attributable to anthropogenic influence. While Marzeion et al. found that anthropogenic influence contributed only 25  35% of glacier mass loss for the period 1851-2010, their naturally-forced simulations exhibited a substantial negative mass balance, which Roe et al. argued is unrealistic. Moreover, Marzeion et al. estimated that anthropogenic influence contributed 69  24% of glacier mass loss for the period 1991 to 2010, consistent with a progressively increasing fraction of mass loss attributable to anthropogenic influence found by Roe et al.. In summary, considering together the SROCC assessment that atmospheric warming was very likely the primary driver of glacier recession, the results of Roe et al. and our assessment of the dominant role of anthropogenic influence in driving atmospheric warming, we conclude that human influence is very likely the main driver of the near-universal retreat of glaciers globally since the 1990s. 3.4.3.2 Ice Sheets Greenland Ice Sheet AR5 assessed that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing contributed to the surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet since 1993. SROCC did not directly assess the attribution of Greenland Ice Sheet change to anthropogenic forcing, but it did assess with medium confidence that summer melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet has increased to a level unprecedented over at least the last 350 years, which is two-tofivefold the pre-industrial level. Section 2.3.2.4.1 assesses that Greenland ice sheet mass loss began in the latter half of the 19th century and the rate of loss has increased substantially since the turn of the 21st century, and also notes that integration of proxy evidence and modelling indicates that the last time the rate of mass loss was similar to the 20th century rate was during the early Holocene. Models of Greenland Ice Sheet evolution are evaluated in detail in Section 9.4.1.2, which assesses that there is overall medium confidence in these models. Model evaluation of surface mass balance changes over the Greenland Ice Sheet, including regional aspects, is also assessed in Atlas.11.2.3. Detection and attribution studies of change in the Greenland Ice Sheet remain challenging. This is in part due to the short observational record (Shepherd et al., 2012, 2018,"}

The latter require not only dynamic ice sheet models, but also appropriate atmospheric and oceanic conditions to use as a boundary forcing to drive the models. Nonetheless, new literature since AR5 finds that ice sheet mass balance calculations using reanalysis-driven regional model simulations of surface mass balance, are found to agree well with the observed decrease in ice sheet mass over the past twenty years, consistent with earlier studies. These studies also show that the exceptional melt events observed in 2012 and 2019 were associated with exceptional atmospheric conditions. These results support the finding that increased surface melting is associated with warming, although atmospheric circulation anomalies, including the summer North Atlantic Oscillation and variations in snowfall play an important role in driving interannual variations. Further, a coupled ice-sheet-climate model study found emergence of decreased surface mass balance prior to the present day in coastal locations in Greenland, which dominate the integrated surface mass balance, suggesting that observed variations in surface mass balance in these regions might be expected to be distinguishable from internal variability. A CMIP6 simulation of the historical period showed stable Greenland surface mass balance up to the 1990s, after which it declined due to increased melt and runoff, consistent with a downscaled reanalysis. Further, all experts surveyed in a structured expert judgement exercise examining the causes of the increase in mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last two decades concluded that external forcing was responsible for at least 50% of the mass loss. A comparison of Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss trends from observations and AR5 model projections for the period 2007-2017 found that observed surface mass balance trends were at the top of the AR5 assessed range, while mass loss due to changing ice dynamics was near the centre of the AR5 range, providing further evidence of consistent anthropogenically-forced mass loss trends in models and observations. Drawing together the evidence from the continued and strengthened observed mass loss, the agreement between anthropogenically forced climate simulations and observations, and historical and paleo evidence for the unusualness of the observed rate of surface melting and mass loss, we assess that it is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades, and there is medium confidence in an anthropogenic contribution to recent overall mass loss from Greenland. Antarctic Ice Sheet AR5 assessed that there was low confidence in attributing the causes of the observed mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet since 1993. SROCC assessed that there is medium agreement but limited evidence of anthropogenic forcing of Antarctic mass balance through both surface mass balance and glacier dynamics. It further assessed that Antarctic ice loss is dominated by acceleration, retreat and rapid thinning of the major West Antarctic Ice Sheet outlet glaciers, driven by melting of ice shelves by warm ocean waters. Based on updated observations, Chapter 2 assesses that there is very high confidence that the Antarctic Ice Sheet lost mass between 1992 and 2017, and that there is medium confidence that this mass loss has accelerated. Models of Antarctic Ice Sheet evolution are evaluated in detail in Section 9.4.2.2, which assesses that there is medium confidence in many ice sheet processes inAntarctic ice sheet models, but low confidence in the ocean forcing affecting basal melt rates. CMIP5 and CMIP6 models perform similarly in their simulation of Antarctic surface mass balance. Model evaluation of surface mass balance over the Antarctic Ice Sheet, including regional aspects, is also assessed in Atlas.11.1.3. Ice discharge around the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is strongly influenced by variability in basal melt, in particular at decadal and longer time scales. Basal melt rate variability can be induced by wind-driven ocean current changes, which may partly be of anthropogenic origin via greenhouse gas forcing. Moreover, ice discharge losses from the Antarctic Ice Sheet over the 2007-2017 period are close to the centre of the model-based range projected in AR5. However, expert opinion differs as to whether recent Antarctic ice loss from the"}

Anthropogenic influence on the Antarctic surface mass balance, which is expected to partially compensate for ice discharge losses through increases in snowfall, is currently masked by strong natural variability, and observations suggest that it has been close to zero over recent years. Overall, there is medium agreement but limited evidence of anthropogenic influence on Antarctic mass balance through changes in ice discharge. 3.5 Human Influence on the Ocean The global ocean plays an important role in the climate system, as it is responsible for transporting and storing large amounts of heat, freshwater and carbon that are exchanged with the atmosphere. Therefore, accurate ocean simulation in climate models is essential for the realistic representation of the climatic response to anthropogenic warming, including rates of warming, sea level rise and carbon uptake, and the representation of coupled modes of climate variability. Ocean model development has advanced considerably since AR5. Ongoing model developments since AR5 have focused on improving the realism of the simulated ocean in coupled models, with horizontal resolutions increasing to 10-100 km, and increased vertical resolutions in many modelling systems of 0-1 m for near-surface levels. These developments are aimed at improving the representation of the diurnal cycle and coupling to the atmosphere. General improvements to simulated ocean fidelity in response to increasing resolution are expected. The effects of model resolution on the fidelity of ocean models are discussed in more detail in Sections 9.2.2 and 9.2.4. In this section we assess the global and basin-scale properties of the simulated ocean, with a focus on evaluation of the realism of simulated ocean properties, and the detection and attribution of human-induced changes in the ocean over the period of observational coverage. Observed changes to ocean temperature, salinity, sea level and ocean circulation are reported in Chapter 2. A more process-based assessment of ocean changes, alongside the assessment of variability and changes in ocean properties with spatial scales smaller than ocean basin scales is presented in Chapter 9. 3.5.1 Ocean Temperature Ocean temperature and ocean heat content are key physical variables considered for climate model evaluation and are primary indicators of a changing ocean climate. This section assesses the performance of climate models in representing the mean state ocean temperature and heat content, with a particular focus on the tropical oceans given the importance of air-sea coupling in these areas. This is followed by an assessment of detection and attribution studies of changes in ocean temperature and heat content. Changes in global surface temperature are assessed in Section 3.3.1.1. 3.5.1.1 Sea Surface and Zonal Mean Ocean Temperature Evaluation In CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, large SST biases were found in the mid and high latitudes. In CMIP6, the NH mid-latitude surface temperature biases appear to be marginally improved in the multimodel mean when contrasted to CMIP5 despite large biases remaining in a few models. There is a decreased spread of the zonal mean SST error between 50N and 30S, relative to CMIP5"}

Misrepresentation of the interaction between the atmosphere and ocean via the Bjerknes feedback and vertical mixing parameterizations, and a bias in winds were among the suggested reasons for the persistent biases. Moving to CMIP6, a reduction of the cold bias in the equatorial cold tongue in the central Pacific is found on average in the CMIP6 models, however, this reduced bias is not statistically significant when considered across the multi-model ensemble. It is also noteworthy that the longitude of the 28C isotherm is closer to observed in CMIP6 than in CMIP5, with a coincident reduction in the CMIP6 inter-model standard deviation. The latter result implies that there is an improvement in the representation of the tropical Pacific mean state in CMIP6 models. Comparison of biases in individual HighResMIP models with biases in lower resolution versions of the same models indicates that there is no consistent improvement in SST biases in most of the equatorial Pacific with resolution. Tropical Atlantic Ocean Fundamental features such as the mean zonal SST gradient in the tropical Atlantic were not reproduced in CMIP5 models. Studies have proposed that weaker than observed alongshore winds, underestimation of stratocumulus clouds, coarse model resolution, and insufficient oceanic cooling due to a deeper thermocline depth and weak vertical velocities at the base of the mixed layer in the eastern basin, underpinned these tropical Atlantic SST gradient biases. The SST gradient biases still remain in CMIP6. On average the cold bias in the western part of the basin is reduced while the warm bias in the eastern part has slightly increased. Several CMIP6 models, however, display large reductions in biases of the zonal SST gradient, such that the eastern equatorial Atlantic warm SST bias and associated westerly wind biases are mostly eliminated in these models. The high resolution CMIP6 models show a better representation of the zonal SST gradient, but some lower resolution models also perform well suggesting that resolution is not the only factor responsible for biases in Tropical Atlantic SST. Tropical Indian Ocean The tropical Indian Ocean mean state is reasonably well simulated both in CMIP5 and CMIP6. However, CMIP5 models show a large spread in the thermocline depth, particularly in the equatorial part of the basin, which has been linked to the parameterization of the vertical mixing and the wind structure, leading to a misrepresentation of the ventilation process in some models. A common problem with the CMIP5 models is therefore a warm bias in the subsurface, mainly at depths around the thermocline, which is also apparent in the CMIP6 models. In the CMIP6 multi-model mean, the western tropical Indian Ocean shows a slightly larger warm bias compared to CMIP5, which in part could be related to excessive supply of warm water from the Red Sea. The HighResMIP models show decreases in SST bias across the Indian Ocean with increasing resolution, though as a group the SST biases in the HighResMIP models are no smaller than those of the full CMIP6 ensemble. In summary, the structure and magnitude of multi-model mean ocean temperature biases have not changed substantially between CMIP5 and CMIP6. Although biases remain in the latest model generation models, the broad consistency between the observed and simulated basin-scale ocean properties suggests that CMIP5 and CMIP6 models are appropriate tools for investigating ocean temperature and ocean heat content responses to forcing. This also provides high confidence in the utility of CMIP-class models for detection and attribution studies, for both ocean heat content and thermosteric sea level applications. 3.5.1.3 Ocean Heat Content Change Attribution"}

Overall, the simulated ocean heat content changes are consistent with the updated and improved observational analyses, within the very likely uncertainty range defined for each as well as with the ocean components of total Earth heating assessed in Section 7.2.2.2, Table 7.1. Nevertheless, large uncertainties remain, particularly in the deeper layers due to the poor temporal and spatial sampling coverage, particularly in the Atlantic, Southern and Indian Oceans. The very likely ranges of the simulated trends for the full ocean depth and below 2000 m fall within the very likely range of observed uptake during the last two decades. In the intermediate layer, the multi-model ensemble mean mostly stays above the observed 5th-95th percentile range before the year 2000. For the upper ocean, some individual model realisations show a reduced ocean heat content increase during the 1970s and 1980s, which is then compensated by a greater warming than the observations from the early 1990s. These discrepancies have been linked with a temporary increase in the Southern Ocean deep water formation rate, as well as with the models strong aerosol cooling effects and high equilibrium climate sensitivity. Nevertheless, both the observed estimates and simulations show that the rate of ocean heat uptake has doubled in the past few decades, when contrasted to the rate over the complete 20th century, with over a third of the accumulated heat stored below 700 m. The Southern Ocean shows the strongest ocean heat uptake that penetrates to deeper layers, whereas ocean heat content increases in the Pacific and Indian Oceans largely occur in the upper layers. Since AR5, the attribution of ocean heat content increases to anthropogenic forcing has been further supported by more detection and attribution studies. These studies have shown that contributions from natural forcing alone cannot explain the observed changes in ocean heat content in either the upper or intermediate ocean layers, and a response to anthropogenic forcing is clearly detectable in ocean heat content. Moreover, a response to greenhouse gas forcing is detectable independently of the response to other anthropogenic forcings, which has offset part of the greenhouse gas induced warming. Further evidence is provided by the agreement between observed and simulated changes in global thermal expansion associated with the ocean heat content increase when both natural and anthropogenic forcings are included in the simulations, though internal variability plays a larger role in driving basin-scale thermosteric sea level trends. Over the Southern Ocean, warming is detectable over the late twentieth century and is largely attributable to greenhouse gases, while other anthropogenic forcings such as ozone depletion have been shown to mitigate the warming in some of the CMIP5 simulations. The use of the mean temperature above a fixed isotherm rather than fixed depth further strengthens a robust detection of the anthropogenic response in the upper ocean, and better accounting for internal variability in the upper ocean, helps explain reported hemispheric asymmetry in ocean heat content change. In summary, there is strong evidence for an improved understanding of the observed global ocean heat content increase. It is extremely likely that human influence was the main driver of the ocean heat content increase observed since the 1970s, which extends into the deeper ocean. Updated observations, like model simulations, show that warming extends throughout the entire water column. 3.5.2 Ocean Salinity While ocean assessments have primarily focused on temperature changes, improved observational salinity products since the early 2000s have supported more assessment of long-term ocean salinity change and"}

Dangendorf et al. determined that for 1900 to 2011 at least 45% of GMSL change is human-induced. A study that developed a semi-empirical model to link sea-level change to observed GMST change concluded that at least 41% of the 20th century sea-level rise would not have happened in the absence of the centurys increasing GMST and that there was a 95% probability that by 1970 GMSL was higher than that which would have occurred in the absence of increasing GMST. Richter et al. compared modelled sea level change with the satellite altimeter observations from 1993 to 2015; a period short enough that internal variability can dominate the spatial pattern of change. They found that when GMSL is not removed, model simulated zonally averaged sea level trends are consistent with altimeter observations globally as well as in each ocean basin and much larger than might be expected from internal variability. Using spatial correlation, Fasullo and Nerem showed that the satellite altimeter trend pattern is already detectable. We note that current detection and attribution studies do not yet include all processes that are important for sea-level change. However, based on the body of literature available, we conclude that the main driver of the observed GMSL rise since at least 1970 is very likely anthropogenic forcing.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. 3.5.4 Ocean Circulation Circulation of the ocean, whether it be wind or density driven, plays a prominent role in the heat and freshwater transport of the Earth system. Thus, its accurate representation is crucial for the realistic representation of water mass properties, and replication of observed changes driven by atmosphere-land-ocean coupling. Here, we assess the ability of CMIP models to reproduce the observed large-scale ocean circulation, along with assessment of the detection and attribution of any anthropogenically-driven changes. We also note that the process-based understanding of these circulation changes and circulation changes occurring at smaller scales are assessed in Section 9.2.3. 3.5.4.1 Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation represents a large-scale flow of warm salty water northward at the surface and a return flow of colder water southward at depth. As such, its mean state plays an important role in transporting heat in the climate system, while its variability can act to redistribute heat. Paleo-climatic and model evidence suggest that changes in AMOC strength have played a prominent role in past transitions between warm and cool climatic phases AR5 concluded that while climate models suggested that an AMOC slowdown would occur in response to anthropogenic forcing, the short direct observational AMOC record precluded it from being used to support this model finding. Chapter 2 reports with high confidence, a weakening of the AMOC was observed in the mid-2000s to the mid-2010s, while again also noting that the observational record was too short to determine"}

That increase was attributed to direct land use and management changes, as well as to CO2 fertilisation, nitrogen deposition, increased diffuse radiation and climate change. The AR5 assessed with high confidence that CMIP5 Earth System Models simulate the global mean land and ocean carbon sinks within the range of observation-based estimates. The IPCC SRCCL, however, noted the remaining shortcomings of carbon cycle schemes in ESMs, which for example do not properly incorporate thermal responses of respiration and photosynthesis, and frequently omit representations of permafrost thaw, the nitrogen cycle and its influence on vegetation dynamics, the phosphorus cycle, and accurate implications of carbon store changes for a range of land use and land management options. This section considers three main large-scale indicators of climate change relevant to the terrestrial carbon cycle: atmospheric CO2 concentration, atmosphere-land CO2 fluxes, and leaf area index. These indicators were chosen because they have been the target of attribution studies. Other indicators, like land use and management, and wildfires, relate to human influence but are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 7 discusses energetic consequences of changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle in Section 7.4.2.5.2. CMIP5 and CMIP6 ESMs are most often run with prescribed observed historical changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and diagnose CO2 emissions consistent with these. Such calculations require that the models simulate realistic changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle over the historical period, as changes to land carbon stores will influence the size of CO2 emissions consistent with prescribed CO2 pathways, and associated remaining carbon budgets. Such testing of existing models is needed while also recognising there are process representations still requiring inclusion. Since the AR5, atmospheric inversion studies have further tested or constrained models, while new datasets have been used to constrain specific parts of the terrestrial carbon cycle such as plant respiration. Figure 3.31 compares historical emissions-driven CMIP6 simulations of global mean atmospheric CO2 concentration and net ocean and land carbon fluxes to the assessed CO2 concentration and fluxes from the Global Carbon Project. For 2014, the CMIP6 models simulate a range of CO2 concentrations centred around the observed value of 397 ppmv, with a range of 381 to 412 ppmv. GSAT anomalies simulated over the historical period are very similar in models that simulate or prescribe changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Most models simulate realistic temporal evolution of the global net ocean and land carbon fluxes, although model spread is larger over land. Although literature published soon after the AR5 highlighted the importance of representing nitrogen limitation on plant growth, more recent studies note that models without nitrogen limitation can still be consistent with the latest estimates of historical carbon cycle changes. Uncertainties in the photosynthetic response to atmospheric CO2 concentrations at global scales, shifts in carbon allocation and turnover, land-use change, and water limitation are also important influences on land carbon fluxes. All models and observational estimates agree that interannual variability in net CO2 uptake is much larger over land than over the ocean. Studies demonstrate that regional variations in both the trends and the yearly strength of the terrestrial carbon sink are considerable. Land carbon uptake is dominated by the extratropical northern latitudes because the tropics may have become a net source of carbon. At local to regional scales, the dominant driver of yearly sink strength variations is water availability, but at continental to global scales, temperature anomalies are the dominant driver. The major role of levels of water stored in the ground in influencing land-atmosphere CO2 exchange has also been confirmed through simultaneous analysis of satellite gravimetry and atmospheric CO2 levels. When considered globally, simulated land and ocean carbon sinks fall within the range of observation-based estimates with high confidence. But there is also high confidence that that apparent success arises for the wrong reasons, as models underestimate the NH carbon sink, as discussed in Section 5.4.5.3."}

This is consistent with the attribution study of observed greening of Mao et al., and with Mao et al. who found that CO2 fertilisation was the dominant cause of enhanced vegetation growth, with latitudinal changes in leaf area index explained by the larger land surface warming in the NH. These conclusions are also consistent with those of Zhu et al., who found a dominant role for CO2 fertilisation in driving leaf area index changes in an attribution study in which land models were first weighted by performance. However, Chen et al. has challenged these results by showing that greening in India and China was driven by land-use change. Leaf area index increases attributed to CO2 fertilisation are due to a direct raised physiological response. However, for drylands, CO2-induced stomatal closure may act to conserve soil moisture and thereby indirectly drive higher photosynthesis through higher water use efficiency. In models with nitrogen deposition, there is evidence that this simulated effect also influences leaf area index trends, however because of a lack of literature based on large-scale land simulations including both nutrient limitation and crop intensification, it is not yet possible to make an attribution statement about their individual roles in leaf area index changes. In summary, Earth system models simulate globally averaged land carbon sinks within the range of observation-based estimates, but global-scale agreement masks large regional disagreements. Based on new studies that attribute changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonal cycle to CO2 fertilisation, albeit counteracted by other factors, combined with the medium confidence that models represent the processes driving changes in the seasonal cycle, we assess that there is medium confidence that CO2 fertilisation is the main driver of the increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2. Based on available literature, CO2 fertilisation has been the main driver of the observed greening trend, but there is only low confidence in this assessment because of ongoing debate about the relative roles of CO2 fertilisation, high latitude warming, and land management, and the low number of models that represent the whole suite of processes involved.

Indices measuring the state of the NAO correlate highly with those of the NAM, and teleconnection patterns for both modes are rather similar. A detailed description of the NAM and the NAO as well as their associated teleconnection over land is given in Annex IV.2.1. AR5 found that while models simulated correctly most of the spatial properties of the NAM, substantial inter-model differences remained in the details of the associated teleconnection patterns over land. AR5 reported that most models did not reproduce the observed positive trend of the NAO/NAM indices during the second half of the 20th century. It was unclear to what extent this failure reflected model shortcomings and/or if the observed trend could be simply related to pronounced internal climate variability. AR5 accordingly did not make an attribution assessment for the NAO/NAM. New studies since the AR5 continue to find that CMIP5 models reproduce the spatial structure and magnitude of the NAM reasonably well although the North Pacific SLP anomalies remain generally too strong and the subtropical North Atlantic lobe of SLP anomalies conversely too weak in many models. Such overall biases noted in both CMIP3 and CMIP5 persist in CMIP6 historical simulations, even though the multi-model multi-member ensemble mean spatial correlation between modelled and observed NAM is slightly higher. Regarding the NAO, the majority of CMIP5 models very successfully simulate its spatial structure and its associations with extratropical jet, storm track and blocking variations over a broad North-Atlantic/Europe domain and over land through teleconnections. The good performance of the models is confirmed in CMIP6 with a marginal improvement of the averaged observation-model spatial correlation and better skill based on other evaluation metrics. The slight underestimation of the SLP anomalies related to the NAO centres of actions over the Azores and Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas remain unchanged compared to CMIP5. CMIP5 models with a model top within the stratosphere seriously underestimate the amplitude of the variability of the wintertime NAM expression in the stratosphere, in contrast to CMIP5 models which extend well above the stratopause. However, even in the latter models, the stratospheric NAM events, and their downward influence on the troposphere, are insufficiently persistent. Increased vertical resolution does not show any significant added value in reproducing the structure and magnitude of the tropospheric NAM nor in the NAO predictability as assessed in a seasonal prediction context with a multi-model approach. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that a correct representation of the Quasi Biennal Oscillation, extratropical stratospheric dynamics, and related troposphere-stratosphere coupling, as well as their interplay with ENSO, are important for NAO/NAM timing, in spite of underestimated troposphere-stratosphere coupling found in models compared to observations. The observed trend of the NAM and NAO indices is positive in winter when calculated from the 1960s but it includes large multidecadal variability, which means that the nature of the trend should be interpreted with caution. The multi-model multi-member ensemble mean of the trend estimated from historical simulations over that period is very close to zero for both CMIP5 and CMIP6. Even if one cannot rule out that 1958-2014 was an exceptional period of variability, the observational estimates of the wintertime NAO trend lie outside the 5th-95th percentile range of the distribution of trends in the CMIP6 historical simulations, and the observed NAM trends over the same period lie above the 90th percentile. There is a tendency for the CMIP5 models to systematically underestimate the level of multidecadal versus interannual variability of the winter NAO and jet stream compared to observations. Results from CMIP6 and over the 1958-2019 period confirm this conclusion and seriously questions the ability of the models to simulate long-term fluctuations of the NAO/NAM, independently of its forced or internal origins."}

In particular, Atlantic and Indian Ocean SST anomalies may have contributed to the long-term positive trend of the winter NAO/NAM over the 20th century, but there is only low confidence in such a causal relationship because of the limitation of the imposed SST approach in AMIP and the uncertainties in observed SST trends among datasets used as forcing of the atmospheric model. The representation of the NAM and NAO spatial structure is slightly improved in AMIP ensembles, which also produce slightly larger trends than the historical simulations for the NAO, but not for the NAM. When calculated over the most recent two decades, the wintertime NAM/NAO trend is weakly negative since the mid-1990s. Recent studies based on observations and dedicated modelling experiments suggest that the recent dominance of negative NAM/NAO could be partly related to the latest shift of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability to a warm phase. Some recent modelling studies also find that the Arctic sea ice decline might be partly responsible for more recurrent negative NAM/NAO, while other studies do not robustly identify such responses in models. In contrast to winter, the observed trend of the NAO index over 1958-2014 is overall negative in summer and is associated with more recurrent blocking conditions over Greenland, in particular since the mid-1990s, thus contributing to the acceleration of melting of the Arctic sea ice and Greenland ice sheet. The origin of the negative trend of the summer NAO has not been clearly identified, and is hypothesized to be the result of combined influences, though trends in summertime NAO should also be interpreted with caution because of the presence of strong multidecadal variability. The recent observed negative NAO prevalence and related blocking over Greenland is not present in any of the CMIP5 models. Regarding the influence of external forcings since pre-industrial time, AR5 noted that CMIP5 models tend to show an increase in the NAM in response to greenhouse gas increases. Based on the CMIP5 historical ensemble, Gillett and Fyfe however showed that such a trend is not significant in all seasons. A multi-model assessment of eight CMIP5 models found a NAM increase in response to greenhouse gases, but no robust influence of aerosol changes. As for ozone depletion, there is no robust detectable influence on long-term trends of the NAO/NAM in contrast to the SAM, but there are indications that extreme Arctic ozone depletion events and their surface expression are linked to an anomalously strong NAM episodes. However, the direction of causality here is not clear. Conclusions on external forcing influences on the NAM are supported by CMIP6 results based on single forcing ensembles. Positive trends are found in historical simulations over 1958-2019 in boreal winter and are mainly driven by greenhouse gas increases. No significant trends are simulated in response to anthropogenic aerosols, stratospheric ozone or natural forcing. Albeit weak and not statistically significant, the sign of the multi-model mean forced response due to natural forcing is consistent with the observed reduction of solar activity since the 1980s whose influence would have favoured the negative phase of wintertime NAM/NAO based on the fingerprint of the nearly periodical 11-year solar cycle extracted from models or observations. But such an NAO response to solar forcing remains highly uncertain and controversial, being contradicted by longer proxy records over the last millenium and modelling evidence. For all seasons and for all individual forcings, uncertainties remain in the estimation of the forced response in the NAM trend as evidenced by considerable model spread and because the simulated forced component has small amplitude compared to internal variability.

In general, there has been no large step change in the representation of ENSO between CMIP5 and CMIP6, however, CMIP6 models appear to better represent some key ENSO characteristics. The instrumental record and paleo-proxy evidence through the Holocene all suggest that ENSO can display considerable modulations in amplitude, pattern and period. For the period since 1850, there is also no clear evidence for a sustained shift in ENSO beyond the range of internal variability. However, paleo-proxy evidence indicates with medium confidence that ENSO variability since 1950 is greater than at any time between 1400 and 1850. Coupled models display large changes of ENSO behaviour in the absence of external forcing changes, and little-to-no variance sensitivity to historical anthropogenic forcing. Thus, there is low confidence that anthropogenic forcing has led to the changes of ENSO variability inferred from paleo-proxy evidence. Chapter 2 reports low confidence that the apparent change from East Pacificto Central Pacific-type El Nino events that occurred in the last 20-30 years was representative of a long term change. While some climate models do suggest external forcing may affect the El Nino event type, most climate models suggest that what has been observed is well within the range of natural variability. Thus, there is low confidence that anthropogenic forcing has had an influence on the observed changes in El Nino event type. 3.7.4 Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole Modes The Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole modes are the two leading modes of interannual SST variability over the tropical Indian Ocean, featuring basin-wide warming/cooling and an east-west dipole of SST anomalies, respectively. The IOD mode is anchored to boreal summer to autumn by the air-sea feedback, and often develops in concert with ENSO. Driven by matured ENSO events, the IOB mode peaks in boreal spring and often persists into the subsequent summer. Similar patterns of Indian Ocean SST variability also dominate its decadal and longer time scale variability. AR5 concluded that models show high and medium performance in reproducing the IOB and IOD modes, respectively, with difficulty in reproducing the persistence of the IOB and the pattern and magnitude of the IOD. There was low confidence that changes in the IOD were detectable or attributable to human influence. Since the AR5, CMIP5 model representation of these modes has been analysed in detail, finding that most of the models qualitatively reproduce the spatial and seasonal features of the IOB and IOD modes. Improvements in simulating the IOB mode since CMIP3 have been identified in reduced multi-model mean bias and inter-model spread. CMIP5 models overall capture the transition from the IOD to IOB modes during an ENSO event. The IOB mode is forced in part through a cross-equatorial wind-evaporation-SST feedback triggered by ENSOforced anomalous ocean Rossby waves that propagate to the shallow climatological thermocline dome in the tropical southwestern Indian Ocean. Consistently, models with a deeper climatological thermocline dome produce a weaker and less persistent IOB mode. The deep thermocline bias remains in the ensemble mean of CMIP5 models due to a common surface easterly wind bias over the equatorial Indian Ocean associated with weaker South Asian summer monsoon circulation. However, the influence of this systematic bias may be compensated by other biases, resulting in a realistic IOB magnitude. Halder et al. found that CMIP6 models reproduce the IOB mode reasonably well, but did not evaluate the progress since CMIP5. By contrast, the IOD magnitude is overestimated by CMIP5 models on average, though with noticeable improvements from CMIP3 models. The overestimation of the IOD magnitude remains in most of 34 CMIP6 models examined in McKenna et al. with worsening on average in July and August. A too steep climatological thermocline slope along the equator due to the surface easterly wind bias in boreal summer and autumn contributes to this IOD magnitude bias through an excessively strong Bjerknes feedback in CMIP5. The surface easterly bias"}

McKenna et al. additionally find degradation in the positivenegative asymmetry of the IOD but an improvement in IOD frequency in a subset of CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5. In terms of teleconnections, the equatorial surface easterly wind bias also affects the IOD-associated moisture transport anomalies toward tropical eastern Africa where the IOD is associated with strong precipitation anomalies in boreal autumn. CMIP5 and CMIP6 models capture the IOD teleconnection to Southern and Central Australian precipitation although it is weaker on average than observed, with no clear improvements from CMIP5 to CMIP6. Strong IOD events could also influence the NH extratropical circulation in winter and in particular the NAM, based on interference between forced Rossby waves emerging from the Indian Ocean and climatological stationary waves. The record positive phase of the NAO/NAM in winter 2019-2020 assessed over the instrumental era has been accordingly linked to the record IOD event of autumn 2019, which has been associated with the devastating record fire season in Australia. The observed Indian Ocean basin-average SST increase on multidecadal and centennial time scales is well represented by CMIP5 historical simulations, and has been attributed to the effects of greenhouse gases offset in part by the effects of anthropogenic aerosols mainly through aerosol-cloud interactions. The observed SST trend is larger in the western than eastern tropical Indian Ocean, which leads to an apparent upward trend of the IOD index, but this trend is statistically insignificant. CMIP5 models capture this warming pattern, which may be associated with Walker circulation weakening over the Indian Ocean due to greenhouse gas forcing. However, strong internal decadal IOD-like variability and observational uncertainty preclude attribution. Such a positive IOD-like change in equatorial zonal SST gradient suggests an increase in the frequency of extreme positive events and skewness of the IOD mode. While there is some evidence of an increase in frequency of positive IOD events during the second half of the 20th century, the current level of IOD variability is not unprecedented in a proxy reconstruction for the last millenium. Besides, the IOD magnitude in the late 20th century is not significantly different between CMIP5 simulations forced by historical and natural-only forcings, though this conclusion is based on only five selected ensemble members that realistically reproduce statistical features of the IOD. While selected CMIP5 models show weakening and seasonality changes in IOD-induced rainfall anomalies in tropical eastern Africa, no comparison with observational records has been made. Likewise, while a strengthening tendency of the ENSO-IOB mode correlation and resultant intensification of the IOB mode are found in historical or future simulations in selected CMIP5 models, such a change has not been detected in observational records. After linear detrending, Pacific decadal variability has been suggested as a driver of decadal-to-multidecadal variations in the IOB mode. However, correlation between the PDV and a decadal IOB index, defined from linearly detrended SST, changed from positive to negative during the 1980s. The increase in anthropogenic forcing and recovery from the eruptions of El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991 may have overwhelmed the PDV influence, and explain this change. However, the low statistical degrees of freedom hamper clear detection of human influence in this correlation change. To summarize, there is medium confidence that changes in the interannual IOD variability in the late 20th century inferred from observations and proxy records are within the range of internal variability. There is no evidence of anthropogenic influence on the interannual IOB. On decadal-to-multidecadal time scales, there is low confidence that human influence has caused a reversal of the correlation between PDV and decadal variations in the IOB mode. The low confidence in this assessment is due to the short observational record, limited number of models used for the attribution, lack of model evaluation of the decadal IOB mode, and uncertainty in the contribution from volcanic aerosols. Nevertheless, CMIP5 models have medium overall performance in reproducing both the interannual IOB and IOD modes, with an apparently good performance in reproducing the IOB magnitude arising from compensation of biases in the formation process, and overly high IOD magnitude due to the mean state bias. There is no clear improvement in the"}

Akin to ENSO in the Pacific, the term Atlantic Nino is broadly used to refer to years when the SSTs in the tropical eastern Atlantic basin along the cold tongue are significantly warmer than the climatological average. The AMM is characterized by anomalous cross-equatorial gradients in SST. Both modes are associated with altered strength of the ITCZ and/or latitudinal shifts in the ITCZ, which locally affect African and American monsoon systems and remotely affect Tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean variability through inter-basins teleconnections. A detailed description of both AZM and AMM, as well as their associated teleconnection over land, is given in Annex IV.2.5 AR5 mentioned the considerable difficulty in simulating both Atlantic Nino and AMM despite some improvements in CMIP5 for some models. Severe biases in mean state and variance for both SST and atmospheric dynamics including rainfall as well as teleconnections were reported. AR5 highlighted the complexity of the Tropical Atlantic biases, which were explained by multiple factors both in the ocean and atmosphere. Since AR5, further analysis of the major persistent biases in models has been reported. Errors in equatorial and basin wide trade winds, cloud cover and ocean vertical mixing and dynamics both locally and in remote subtropical upwelling regions, key thermodynamic ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, and tropical land-atmosphere interaction have been shown to be detrimental to the representation of both the Atlantic Nino and AMM leading to poor teleconnectivity over land and between tropical basins. Despite some improvements, biases in the mean state are so large that the mean east-west temperature gradient at the equator along the thermocline remains opposite to observed in two thirds of the CMIP5 models, which clearly affects the simulation of the Atlantic Nino and associated dynamics. The interhemispheric SST gradient is also systematically underestimated in models with a too cold mean state in the northern part of the Tropical Atlantic ocean and too warm conditions in the Southern Atlantic basin. The seasonality is poorly reproduced and the wind-SST coupling is weaker than observed so that altogether, and despite AMM-like variability in 20th century climate simulations, AMM is not the dominant Atlantic mode in all CMIP5 models. These biases in mean state translate into biases in modelling the mean ITCZ. Similar biases were found in experiments using CMIP5 models but with different climate background states, such as Last Glacial Maximum, Mid-Holocene and future scenario simulations. Analyses from CMIP6 show encouraging results in the representation of Atlantic Nino and AMM modes of variability in terms of amplitude and seasonality. Some models now display reduced biases in the spatial structure of the modes and related explained variance but persistent errors still remain on average in the timing of the modes and in the coupled nature of the modes, i.e. the strength of the link between ocean and atmospheric anomalies, as well as in the Indian Ocean equatorial east-west temperature gradient. There are some recent indications that increasing model resolution both vertically and horizontally, in the ocean and atmospheric component, could partly alleviate some tropical Atlantic biases in mean state, seasonality, interannual-to-decadal variability and associated teleconnectivity over land, such as with the West African monsoon. Results from CMIP6 tend to confirm that increasing resolution is not the unique way to address the"}

For instance, the inclusion of a stochastic physics scheme has a nearly equivalent effect in the improvement of the mean number and the strength distribution of tropical Atlantic cyclones. Section 2.4.4 assess that there is low confidence in any sustained changes to the AZM and AMM variability in instrumental observations. Moreover any attribution of possible human influence on the Atlantic Modes and associated teleconnections is limited by the poor fidelity of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models in reproducing the mean tropical Atlantic climate, its seasonality and variability, despite hints of some improvement in CMIP6, as well as other sources of uncertainties related to limited process understanding in the observations, the response of the tropical Atlantic climate to anthropogenic aerosol forcing and the presence of strong multidecadal fluctuations related to AMV and cross-tropical basin interactions. The fact that most models poorly represent the climatology and variability of the tropical Atlantic combined with the short observational record makes it difficult to place the recent observed changes in the context of internal multiannual variability versus anthropogenic forcing. In summary, based on CMIP5 and CMIP6 results, there is no robust evidence that the observed changes in either the Atlantic Nino or AMM modes and associated teleconnections over the second half of the 20th century are beyond the range of internal variability or have been influenced by natural or anthropogenic forcing. Considering the physical processes responsible for model biases in these modes, increasing resolution in both ocean and atmosphere components may be an opportunity for progress in the simulation of the tropical Atlantic changes as evidenced by some individual model studies, but this needs confirmation from a multi-model perspective. 3.7.6 Pacific Decadal Variability Pacific decadal variability is the generic term for the modes of variability in the Pacific Ocean that vary on decadal to interdecadal timescales. PDV and its related teleconnections encompass the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and an anomalous SST pattern in the North Pacific, as well as a broader structure associated with Pacific-wide SSTs termed the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Since the PDO and IPO indices are highly correlated, this section assesses them together as the PDV. AR5 mentioned an overall limited level of evidence for both CMIP3 and CMIP5 evaluation of the Pacific modes at interdecadal timescales, leading to low confidence statements about the models performance in reproducing PDV and similarly low confidence in the attribution of observed PDV changes to human influence. The implication of PDV in the observed slowdown of the GMST warming rate in the early 2000s has triggered considerable research on decadal climate variability and predictability since the AR5. Many studies find that the broad spatial characteristics of PDV are reasonably well represented in unforced climate models and in historical simulations in CMIP5 and CMIP6, although there is sensitivity to methodology used to remove the externally-forced component of the SST. Compared with CMIP3 models, CMIP5 models exhibit overall slightly better performance in reproducing PDV and associated teleconnections, and also smaller inter-model spread. CMIP6 models on average show slightly improved reproduction of the PDV spatial structure than CMIP5 models. SST anomalies in the subtropical South Pacific lobe are however too weak relative to the equatorial and North Pacific lobes in CMIP5 pre-industrial control and historical simulations, a bias that remains in CMIP6. Biases in the PDV temporal properties and amplitude are present in CMIP5 (Cheung et al., 2017; Henley,"}
{"id": "83_variability_pacific_sst_circulation", "topic_number": 83, "topic_probability": 0.9301432126077693, "terms": ["variability", "pacific", "sst", "circulation", "cmip5", "atlantic", "tropical", "decadal", "models", "enso"], "paragraph_id": "f4c39366d9f2a9faa397bd163ba881610ca1a621c20be37e5725ef7bded3a38f.PG811.PA3", "paragraph_clean_text": "2017). While model evaluation is severely hampered by short observational records and incomplete observational coverage before satellite measurements started, the duration of PDV phases appears to be shorter in coupled models than in observations, and correspondingly the ratio of decadal to interannual variance is underestimated. This apparent bias may be associated with overly biennial behaviour of Pacific trade wind variability and related ENSO activity, leaving too weak variability on decadal timescales. ENSO influence on the extratropical North Pacific Ocean at decadal timescales is also very diverse among both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, being controlled by multiple factors. In terms of amplitude, the variance of the PDV index after decadal filtering is significantly weaker in the concatenated CMIP5 ensemble than the three observational estimates used in Figure 3.39e. Consequently, the observed PDV fluctuations over the historical period often lie in the tails of the model distributions. Even if one cannot rule out that the observed PDV over the instrumental era represents an exceptional period of variability, it is plausible that the tendency of the CMIP5 models to systematically underestimate the low frequency variance is due to an incomplete representation of decadal-scale mechanisms in these models. This situation is slightly improved in CMIP6 historical simulations but remains a concern. The results of McGregor et al. suggest that the underrepresentation of the magnitude stems from Atlantic mean SST bias through inter-basin coupling. While PDV is primarily understood as an internal mode of variability, there are some indications that anthropogenically induced SST changes project onto PDV and have contributed to its past evolution. However, the level of evidence is limited because of the difficulty in correctly separating internal versus externally forced components in the observed SST variations, and because it is unclear whether the dynamics of the PDV are operative in this forced SST change pattern. Over the last two to three decades which encompass the period of slower GMST increase, Smith et al. found that anthropogenic aerosols have driven part of the PDV change toward its negative phase. A similar result is shown in Takahashi and Watanabe who found intensification of the Pacific Walker circulation in response to aerosol forcing. Indeed, CMIP6 models simulate a negative PDV trend since the 1980s, which is much weaker than internal variability. However, a response to anthropogenic aerosols is not robustly identified in a large ensemble of a model, across CMIP5 models, or in idealized model simulations. Alternatively, inter-basin teleconnections associated with the warming of the North Atlantic Ocean related to the mid-1990s phase shift of the AMV, and also in the Indian Ocean, could have favoured a delayed PDV transition to its negative phase in the 2000s. Considering the possible influence of external forcing on Indian Ocean decadal variability and AMV, any such human influence on PDV would be indirect through changes in these ocean basins, and then imported to the Pacific via inter-basin coupling. However, this human influence on AMV, and how consistently the inter-basin processes affect PDV phase shifts, are uncertain. Other modelling studies find that anthropogenic aerosols can influence the PDV. It is however unclear whether and how much those forcings contributed to the observed variations of PDV. In CMIP6 models, the temporal correlation of the multi-model ensemble mean PDV index with its observational counterpart is insignificant and negligible, suggesting that any externally-driven component in historical PDV variations was weak. Lastly, the multi-model ensemble mean computed from CMIP6 historical simulations shows slightly stronger variation than the CMIP5 counterpart, suggesting a greater simulated influence from external forcings in CMIP6. Still, the fraction of the forced signal to the total PDV is very low, in contrast to AMV. Consistently, Liguori et al. estimate that the variance fraction of the externally-driven to total PDV is up to only 15% in a multi-model large ensemble of historical simulations. These findings support an assessment that PDV is mostly driven by internal variability since the pre-industrial era. The sensitivity of ensemble-mean PDV trends to the ensemble size, and the dominance of the ensemble spread over the ensemble mean in the 60-year trend of the equatorial Pacific zonal SST gradient in large ensemble simulations, also support this statement. In CMIP5 last millennium simulations, there is no consistency in temporal variations of PDV across the"}

But AR5 also concluded that models show medium performance in reproducing the observed AMV, with difficulties in simulating the timescale, the spatial structure and the coherency between all the physical processes involved. Climate models analyzed since AR5 continue to simulate AMV-like variability as part of their internal variability. This statement is mostly based on CMIP5 pre-industrial control and historical simulations and is also true for the CMIP6 models. Models also continue to support links to a wide array of remote climate influences through atmospheric teleconnections. Even if debate remains, there is now stronger evidence for a crucial role of oceanic dynamics in internal AMV that is primarily linked to the AMOC and its interplay with the NAO. However, considerable diversity in the spatio-temporal properties of the simulated AMV is found in both pre-industrial control and historical CMIP5 experiments. Such model diversity is presumably associated with the wide range of coupled processes associated with AMV including large-scale atmospheric teleconnections and regional feedbacks relating to tropical clouds, Arctic sea ice in the subarctic basins and Saharan dust, whose relative importance and interactions across timescales are specific to each model. Additional studies since AR5 corroborate that CMIP5-era models tend to underestimate many aspects of observed AMV and its SST fingerprint. On average, the duration of the modelled AMV episodes is too short, its magnitude is too weak and its basin-wide SST spatial structure is limited by the poor representation of the link between the tropical North Atlantic and the subpolar North Atlantic/Nordic seas. Such mismatches between observed and simulated AMV have been associated with intrinsic model biases in both mean state and variability in the ocean and overlying atmosphere. For instance, compared to available observational data CMIP5 models underestimate the ratio of decadal to interannual variability of the main drivers of AMV, namely the AMOC, NAO and related North Atlantic jet variations, which has strong implications for the simulated temporal statistics of AMV, AMV-induced teleconnections and AMV predictability. The increase of AMV variance in CMIP6 models seems to be explained by the enhanced variability in the subpolar North Atlantic SST, which is particularly pronounced in some models, associated with greater variability in the AMOC and greater GMST multidecadal variability. The decadal variance in SST in the subpolar North Atlantic seems now to be slightly overestimated in CMIP6 compared to observational estimates, while the AMV-related tropical SST anomalies remains weaker in line with CMIP5. The mechanisms producing the tropical-extratropical relationship at decadal timescales remain poorly understood despite stronger evidence since AR5 for the importance of the subpolar gyre SST anomalies in generating tropical changes through atmospheric teleconnection. Significant discrepancies remain in the simulated AMV spatial pattern when historical simulations are compared to multivariate observations. There is additional evidence since AR5 that external forcing has been playing an important role in shaping the timing and intensity of the observed AMV since pre-industrial times. The time synchronisation between observed and multi-model mean AMV SST indices is significant in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations, while the explained variance of the forced response in CMIP6 appears stronger.

They encompass a range of climate drivers, such as volcanic and solar forcing for the Last Millennium, orbital forcing for the midHolocene and Last Interglacial, and changes in greenhouse gases and ice sheets for the LGM, mid-Pliocene Warm Period, and early Eocene. These drivers led to climate changes, including in surface temperature and the hydrological cycle, which are described by paleoclimate proxies that have been synthesised to support evaluations of models on a global and regional scale. However, the more sparse, indirect, and regionally incomplete climate information available from paleo-archives motivates a different form for the multivariate analysis of simulations available covering these periods versus the equivalent for the historical period, as described below. AR5 found that reconstructions and simulations of past climates both show similar responses in terms of large-scale patterns of climate change, such as polar amplification. However, for several regional signals, the magnitude of change seen in the proxies relative to the pre-industrial period was underestimated by the models. When benchmarking CMIP5/PMIP3 models against reconstructions of the mid-Holocene and LGM, AR5 found only a slight improvement compared with earlier model versions across a range of variables. For the Last Interglacial, it was noted that the magnitude of observed annual mean warming in the NH was only reached in summer in the models. For the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, it was noted that both proxies and models showed a polar amplification of temperature compared with the pre-industrial period, but a formal model evaluation was not carried out. Since AR5, new simulation protocols have been developed in the framework of PMIP4 which is further described for the mid-Holocene and the Last Interglacial by Otto-Bliesner et al., for the LGM by Kageyama et al., for the Pliocene by Haywood et al., and for the early Eocene by Lunt et al.. These have resulted in new model simulations for these time periods. These time periods span an assessed temperature range of 20C, and for all periods the PMIP4 model ensemble mean is within 0.5C of the assessed range of GSAT. Those time periods for which the model ensemble mean is outside the assessed range of GSAT, the mid-Holocene and the Last Interglacial, are primarily forced by orbital changes not greenhouse gas forcing, and as a result the forcing, as well as the assessed and modelled response, are relatively close to zero in the global annual mean. During these periods, climate change therefore is a consequence of more poorly understood Earth System feedbacks acting on the response to orbital differences versus the present-day, affecting the seasonality of insolation. Polar amplification in the LGM, mid-Pliocene Warm Period, and Early Eocene climatic optimum simulations are assessed in Section 7.4.4. Here we focus on the mid-Holocene and the LGM, which have been a part of AMIP or CMIP through several assessment cycles, and as such serve as a reference to quantify regional model-data agreement from one IPCC assessment to another. We compare the results from 15 CMIP6 models using the PMIP4 protocol, with non-CMIP6 models using the PMIP4 protocol, with PMIP3 models, and with regional temperature and precipitation changes from proxies for the mid-Holocene. For 6 out of 7 variables shown, the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures the correct sign of the change. For 5 out of 7 of them the CMIP6 ensemble mean is within the reconstructed range. For the other two variables nearly all PMIP4 and PMIP3 models are outside the reconstructed range. CMIP6 models show regional patterns of temperature changes similar to the PMIP3 ensemble, but the slight mid-Holocene cooling in PMIP4 compared with PMIP3, probably associated with lower imposed mid-Holocene carbon dioxide concentrations, improves the regional model performance for summer and winter temperatures. However, this cooling also results in a CMIP6 mid-Holocene GSAT that lies further from the assessed range. All models show an expansion of the monsoon areas from the pre-industrial to the midHolocene simulations in the NH, but this expansion in some cases is only large enough to cancel out the bias in the pre-industrial control simulations. There is a slight improvement in representing the northward expansion of the West African monsoon region in PMIP4 compared with PMIP3."}

Yes, climate models have improved and continue to do so, becoming better at capturing complex and smallscale processes and at simulating present-day mean climate conditions. This improvement can be measured by comparing climate simulations against historical observations. Both the current and previous generations of models show that increases in greenhouse gases cause global warming. While past warming is well simulated by the new generation models as a group, some individual models simulate past warming that is either below or above what is observed. The information about how well models simulate past warming, as well as other insights from observations and theory, are used to refine this Reports projections of global warming. Climate models are important tools for understanding past, present and future climate change. They are sophisticated computer programs that are based on fundamental laws of physics of the atmosphere, ocean, ice, and land. Climate models perform their calculations on a three-dimensional grid made of small bricks or grid cells of about 100 km across. Processes that occur on scales smaller than the model grid cells are treated in a simplified way. This simplification is done differently in different models. Some models include more processes and complexity than others; some represent processes in finer detail than others. Hence the simulated climate and climate change vary between models. Climate modelling started in the 1950s and, over the years, models have become increasingly sophisticated as computing power, observations and our understanding of the climate system have advanced. The models used in the IPCC First Assessment Report published in 1990 correctly reproduced many aspects of climate. The actual evolution of the climate since then has confirmed these early projections, when accounting for the differences between the simulated scenarios and actual emissions. Models continue to improve and get better and better at simulating the large variety of important processes that affect climate. For example, many models now simulate complex interactions between different aspects of the Earth system, such as the uptake of carbon by vegetation on land and by the ocean, and the interaction between clouds and air pollutants. While some models are becoming more comprehensive, others are striving to represent processes at higher resolution, for example to better represent the vortices and swirls in currents responsible for much of the transport of heat in the ocean. Scientists evaluate the performance of climate models by comparing historical model simulations to observations. This evaluation includes comparison of large-scale averages as well as more detailed regional and seasonal variations. There are two important aspects to consider: how models perform individually and how they perform as a group. The average of many models often compares better against observations than any individual model, since errors in representing detailed processes tend to cancel each other out in multi-model averages. As an example, FAQ 3.3 Figure 1 compares simulations from the three most recent generations of models with observations of three climate variables. It shows the correlation between simulated and observed patterns, where a value of 1 represents perfect agreement. Many individual models of the new generation perform significantly better, as indicated by values closer to 1. As a group, each generation out-performs the previous generation: the multi-model average is progressively closer to 1. The vertical extent of the colored bars indicates the range of model performance across each group. The top of the bar moves up with each generation, indicating improved performance of the best performing models from one generation to the next. In the case of precipitation, the performance of the worst performing models is similar in the two most recent model generations, increasing the spread across models. Developments in the latest generation of climate models, including new and better representation of physical, chemical and biological processes, as well as higher resolution, have improved the simulation of many aspects of the Earth system. These simulations, along with the evaluation of the ability of the models to simulate past warming as well as the updated assessment of the temperature response to a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, are used to estimate the range of future global warming."}

The influence of natural variability is shown by the green bars, and it decreases with longer time scales. The data is sourced from the CESM1 large ensemble."}

However, it is very likely that ENSO rainfall variability, used for defining extreme El Ninos and La Ninas, will increase significantly, regardless of amplitude changes in ENSO SST variability, by the second half of the 21st century in scenarios SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP58.5. Cryosphere and Ocean Under the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, it is likely that the Arctic Ocean in September, the month of annual minimum sea ice area, will become practically ice-free averaged over 20812100 and all available simulations. Arctic sea ice area in March, the month of annual maximum sea ice area, also decreases in the future under each of the considered scenarios, but to a much lesser degree than in September. Under the five scenarios assessed, it is virtually certain that global mean sea level will continue to rise through the 21st century. For the period 20812100 relative to 19952014, GMSL is likely to rise by 0.460.74 m under SSP3-7.0 and by 0.300.54 m under SSP1-2.6. For the assessment of change in GMSL, the contribution from land-ice melt has been added offline to the CMIP6simulated contributions from thermal expansion. It is very likely that the cumulative uptake of carbon by the ocean and by land will increase through to the end of the 21st century. Carbon uptake by land shows greater increases but with greater uncertainties than for ocean carbon uptake. The fraction of emissions absorbed by land and ocean sinks will be smaller under high emission scenarios than under low emission scenarios. Ocean surface pH will decrease steadily through the 21st century, except for SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 where values decrease until around 2070 and then increase slightly to 2100. Climate Response to Emission Reduction, Carbon Dioxide Removal, and Solar Radiation Modification If strong mitigation is applied from 2020 onward as reflected in SSP1-1.9, its effect on 20-year trends in GSAT would likely emerge during the near term, measured against an assumed nonmitigation scenario such as SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. However, the response of many other climate quantities to mitigation would be largely masked by internal variability during the near term, especially on the regional scale. The mitigation benefits for these quantities would emerge only later during the 21st century. During the near term, a small fraction of the surface can show cooling under all scenarios assessed here, so near-term cooling at any given location is fully consistent with GSAT increase. Events of reduced and increased GSAT trends at decadal timescales will continue to occur in the 21st century but will not affect the centennial warming. Because of the near-linear relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and GSAT change, the cooling or avoided warming from carbon dioxide removal is proportional to the cumulative amount of CO2 removed by CDR. The climate system response to net negative CO2 emissions is expected to be delayed by years to centuries. Net negative CO2 emissions due to CDR will not reverse some climate change, such as sea level rise, at least for several centuries. The climate effect of a sudden and sustained CDR termination would depend on the amount of CDR-induced cooling prior to termination and the rate of background CO2 emissions at the time of termination. Solar radiation modification could offset some of the effects of anthropogenic warming on global and regional climate, but there would be substantial residual and overcompensating climate change at the regional scale and seasonal timescale, and there is low confidence in our understanding of the climate response to SRM, specifically at the regional scale. Since the AR5, understanding of the global and regional climate response to SRM has improved, due to modelling work with more sophisticated treatment of aerosol-based SRM options and stratospheric processes. Improved modelling suggests that multiple climate goals could be met simultaneously. A sudden and sustained"}

Assessment of uncertainty relies on multi-model ensembles such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, single-model initial-condition large ensembles, and ensembles initialized from the observed climate state. Ensemble evaluation methods include assessment of model performance and independence; emergent and other observational constraints; and the uncertainty assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response in Chapter 7.

Stochastic physics can markedly improve the internal variability in a given model. Stochastic physics can also correct long-standing mean-state biases and can influence the predicted climate sensitivity. Perturbed-physics ensembles are also used to systematically account for parameter uncertainty in a given model. Uncertain model parameters are identified and ranges in their values selected that conform to emergent observational constraints. These parameters are then changed between ensemble members to sample the effect of parameter uncertainty on climate. It is possible to weight ensemble members according to some performance metric or emergent constraint to improve the ensemble distribution. 4.2.2 Scenarios The AR5 drew heavily on four main scenarios, known as Representative Concentration Pathways, and simulation results from CMIP5. The RCPs were labelled by the approximate radiative forcing reached at the year 2100, going from 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 to 8.5 W m-2. This chapter draws on model simulations from CMIP6 using a new range of scenarios based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways. The set of SSPs is described in detail in Chapter 1 and recognizes that global radiative forcing levels can be achieved by different pathways of CO2, non-CO2 greenhouse gases, aerosols, and land use; the set of SSPs therefore establishes a matrix of global forcing levels and socioeconomic storylines. ScenarioMIP identifies four priority scenarios that participating modelling groups are asked to perform, SSP1-2.6 for sustainable pathways, SSP2-4.5 for middle-of-the-road, SSP3-7.0 for regional rivalry, and SSP5-8.5 for fossil-fuel-rich development. This chapter focuses its assessment on these, plus the SSP1-1.9 scenario, which is directly relevant the assessment of the 1.5C Paris Agreement goal. Further, this chapter discusses these scenarios and their extensions past 2100 in the context of the very long-term climate change in Section 4.7.1. Projections of short-lived climate forcers are assessed in more detail in Chapter 6. In presenting results and evidence, this chapter tries to be as comprehensive as possible. In tables we show multi-model mean change and 595% range for all five SSPs, while in time series figures we show multimodel mean change for all five SSPs but for clarity 595% range only for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. Where maps are presented, due to space restrictions we focus on showing multi-model mean change for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. SSP1-2.6 is preferred over SSP1-1.9 because the latter has far fewer simulations available. The high-end scenarios RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 have recently been argued to be implausible to unfold (e.g.,; see Chapter 3 of the AR6 WGIII). However, where relevant we show results for SSP5-8.5, for example to enable backwards compatibility with AR5, for comparison between emissiondriven and concentration-driven simulations, and because there is greater data availability of daily output for SSP5-8.5. When presenting low-likelihood high-warming storylines we also show results from the high-end SSP5-8.5 scenario. ScenarioMIP simulations include advances in techniques to better harmonize with historical forcings relative to CMIP5. For example, projected changes in the solar cycle include long-term modulation rather than a repeating solar cycle. Background natural aerosols are ramped down to an average historical level used in the control simulation by 2025 and background volcanic forcing is ramped up from the value at the end of the historical simulation period over 10 years to the same constant value prescribed for the piControl simulations in the DECK, and then kept fixed  both changes are intended to avoid inconsistent model treatment of unknowable natural forcing to affect the near-term projected warming."}

For both approaches, unrealistic features in the observation data used for initialization may induce unrealistic transient behavior, and non-linearity can reduce forecast skill. As yet, neither of the initialization strategies has been clearly shown to be superior, although such comparisons may be sensitive to the model, region, and details of the initialization and forecast assessment procedures considered. There is also a wide range of techniques employed to assimilate observed information into models in order to generate suitable initial conditions. These range in complexity from simple relaxation towards observed time series of sea surface temperature or wind stress anomalies, to relaxation toward three-dimensional ocean and sometimes atmospheric state estimates from various sources, or hybrid relaxation combining surface and tri-dimensional restoring as function of ocean basins and depth, to sophisticated data assimilation methods such as the ensemble Kalan filter the four-dimensional ensemble-variational hybrid data assimilation and the initialization of sea ice. In addition, decadal predictions necessarily consist of ensembles of forecasts to quantify uncertainty as discussed in Section 4.2.1. A common way to generate an ensemble is through sets of initial conditions containing small variations that lead to different subsequent climate trajectories. A variety of methods and assumptions has been employed to generate and filter initial-condition ensembles for decadal prediction. As yet, there is no clear consensus as to which initialization and ensemble generation techniques are most effective, and evaluations of their comparative performance within a single modelling framework are needed. A consequence of model imperfections and resulting model systematic errors is that estimates of these errors must be removed from the prediction to isolate the predicted climate anomaly and the phase of the decadal modes of climate variability. Because of the tendency for systematic drifts to occur following initialization, bias corrections generally depend on time since the start of the forecast, often referred to as lead time. In practice, the lead-timedependent biases are calculated using ensemble retrospective predictions, also known as hindcasts, and recommended basic procedures for such corrections are provided in previous studies. The biases are also dynamically corrected during hindcasts and predictions by incorporating the multi-year monthly mean analysis increments from the initialization into the initial condition at each integration step. Besides mean climate as a function of lead time, further aspects of decadal predictions may be biased, such as the modes of variability upon which drift patterns are projecting, and additional correction procedures have thus been proposed to remove biases in representing long-term trends, as well as more general dependences of drift on initial conditions. Many skill measures exist that describe different aspects of the correspondence between predicted and observed conditions, and no single metric should be considered exclusively. Important aspects of forecast performance captured by different skill measures include: 1) the ability to predict the sign and phases of the main modes of decadal variability and their regional fingerprint through teleconnections; 2) the typical magnitude of differences between predicted and observed values, forecast reliability and resolution; and 3) whether the forecast ensemble appropriately represents uncertainty in the predictions. A framework for skill assessment that encompasses each of these aspects of forecast quality has been proposed. A new, process-based method to assess forecast skill in decadal predictions is to analyse how well a specific mechanism is represented at each lead time. One additional aspect of forecast quality assessment is that estimated skill can be degraded by errors in observational datasets used for verification, in addition to errors in the predictions. This suggests that skill may tend to be"}

Skill assessments have shown that initialized predictions can out-perform their uninitialized counterparts, although such comparisons are sensitive to the region and variable considered, multimodel predictions are generally more skilful than individual models. Considerable skill, especially for temperature, can be attributed to external forcings such as changes in GHG, aerosol concentrations, and volcanic eruptions. On a global scale, this contribution to skill has been found to exceed that from the prediction of internal variability except in the early stages of the forecast(Sospedra-Alfonso and Boer, 2020)(Bilbao et al., 2021), though idealized potential skill measures and observations-based studies suggest that improving the prediction of internal variability could extend this crossover to longer lead times. In some cases, part of the skill arises from the ability of initialized predictions to capture observed transitions of major modes of climate variability such as the Pacific Decadal Variability and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability. Initialized predictions of near-surface temperature are particularly skilful over the North Atlantic, a region of high potential and realised predictability. Much of this predictability is associated with the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, where skill in predicting ocean conditions is typically high and shifts in ocean temperature and salinity potentially affecting surface climate can be predicted up to several years in advance, although such assessments remain challenging due to incomplete knowledge of the state of the ocean during the hindcast evaluation periods. A substantial improvement of the sub-polar gyre SST prediction is found in CMIP6 models, which is attributed to a more accurate response to the AMOC-related delayed response to volcanic eruptions. A significant improvement GSAT prediction skill is also found over some land regions including East Asia, Eurasia, Europe and the Middle East. Skill for multi-year to decadal precipitation forecasts is generally much lower than for temperature, although one exception is Sahel rainfall, due to its dependence on predictable variations in North Atlantic SST through teleconnections. Predictive skill on decadal timescales is found for extratropical storm-tracks and storm density, atmospheric blocking, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and over the tropical oceans. In addition, decadal predictions with large ensemble sizes are able to predict multi-annual temperature(Sienz et al., 2016)(Borchert et al., 2019), precipitation, and atmospheric circulation anomalies over certain land regions, although the ensemble-mean magnitudes are much weaker than observed. This discrepancy may be symptomatic of an apparent deficiency in climate models that causes some predictable signal, such as that associated to the North Atlantic Oscillation, to be much weaker than in nature, while others, such as that linked to the Southern Annular Mode, are more consistent with observations Evidence is accumulating that additional properties of the Earth system relating to ocean variability may be skilfully predicted on multi-annual timescales. These include levels of Atlantic hurricane activity, winter sea-ice in the Arctic, drought and wildfire, and variations in the ocean carbon cycle including CO2 uptake and chlorophyll."}

Furthermore, there are indications that initialized predictions can constrain near-term projections.

By contrast, there is medium or low confidence that uncertainty is reduced for other climate variables. 4.2.4 Pattern Scaling Projected climate change is typically represented in this chapter for specific future periods. One important source of uncertainty in projections presented for fixed future epochs is the underlying scenario used; another is the structural uncertainty associated with model climate sensitivity. Presenting projections and associated measures of uncertainty for specific periods remains the most widely applied methodology towards informing climate change impact studies. It is becoming increasingly important from the perspective of climate change and mitigation policy, however, to present projections also as a function of the change in global mean temperature. They are expressed either in terms of changes of global mean surface temperature or GSAT. For example, the IPCC SR1.5 assessed the regional patterns of warming and precipitation change for GMST increase of 1.5C and 2C above 18501900 levels. Techniques used to represent the spatial variations in climate at a given GWL are referred to as pattern scaling. In the traditional methodology as applied in the AR5, patterns of climate change in space are calculated as the product of the change in GSAT at a given point in time and a spatial pattern of change that is constant over time and the scenario under consideration, and which may or may not depend on a particular climate model. This approach assumes that external forcing does not affect the internal variability of the climate system, which may be regarded a stringent assumption when taking into account decadal and multi-decadal variability and the potential nonlinearity of the climate change signal. Moreover, pattern scaling is expected to have lower skill for variables with large spatial variability. Pattern scaling also fails to capture changes in boundaries that moves poleward such as sea-ice extent and snow cover, and temporal frequency quantities such as frost days that decrease under warming but are bounded at zero. Spatial patterns are also expected to be different between transient and equilibrium simulations because of the long adjustment timescale of the deep ocean. Further developments of the AR5 approach have since explored the role of aerosols in modifying regional climate responses at a specific degree of global warming and also the effect of different GCMs and scenarios on the scaled spatial patterns. Furthermore, the modified forcingresponse framework, which decomposes the total climate change into fast adjustments and slow response, identifies the fast adjustment as forcing-dependent and the slow response as forcing-independent, scaling with the change in GSAT. For precipitation change, there is near-zero fast adjustment for solar forcing but suppression during the fastadjustment phase for CO2 and black-carbon radiative forcing. By contrast, the slow response in precipitation change is independent of the forcing. This indicates that pattern scaling is not expected to work well for climate variables that have a large fast-adjustment component. Even in such cases, pattern scaling still works for the slow response component, but a correction for the forcing-dependent fast adjustment would be necessary to apply pattern scaling to the total climate change signal. In a multi-model setting, it has been shown that temperature change patterns conform better to pattern scaling approximation than precipitation patterns. have explored the use of multiple predictors for the spatial pattern of change at a given"}

Some literature exists comparing previous IPCC projections to what has unfolded over the subsequent decades, and recent work has confirmed that climate models since around 1970 have projected global surface warming in reasonable agreement with observations once the difference between assumed and actual forcing has been taken into account. However, the long-term perspective to the end of the 21st century or even out to 2300 takes us beyond what can be observed in time for a standard evaluation of model projections, and in this sense the assessment of long-term projections will remain fundamentally limited. The spread across individual runs within a multi-model ensemble represents the response to a combination of different sources of uncertainties, specifically: scenario uncertainties, climate response uncertainties related to parametric and other structural uncertainties in the model representation of the climate system, and internal variability. While the nature of these uncertainties was introduced in Section 1.4.3, this subsection assesses methods to disentangle different sources of uncertainties and quantify their contributions to the overall ensemble spread. As discussed extensively in the AR5, ensemble spread in projections performed with different climate models accounts for only part of the entire model uncertainty, even when considering the uncertainty in the radiative forcing in projections and forced response. The AR5 uncertainty characterisation followed Hawkins and Sutton and diagnosed internal variability through a high-pass temporal filter. This approach has deficiencies particularly if internal variability manifests on the multi-decadal timescales and is classified as response uncertainty instead of internal variability. Single-model initial-condition large ensembles revealed that the AR5 approach underestimates the role of internal variability uncertainty and overestimates the role of model uncertainty particularly at the local scale while yielding a reasonable approximation for uncertainty separation for GSAT. Single-model initial-condition large ensembles thus represent a crucial step towards a cleaner separation of model uncertainty and internal variability than available for the AR5. Novel approaches have been proposed to further quantify internal variability in multi-model ensembles. For time horizons beyond the limit of decadal predictability, such as in the CMIP6 projections, the simulations are starting from random rather than assimilated initial conditions. Internal variability constitutes an uncertainty in the projection of the climate in a future period of 10 or 20 years that is irreducible, but can be precisely quantified for individual models using sufficiently large initial-condition ensembles. Uncertainties in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols that affect future radiative forcings are represented by selected SSP scenarios. In addition to emission uncertainties, SSPs represent uncertainties in land use changes(Ciais et al., 2013)(ONeill et al., 2016)(Christensen et al., 2018). Additional uncertainty comes from climate carbon-cycle feedbacks and the residence time of atmospheric constituents, and are at least partly accounted for in emission-driven simulations as opposed to concentration-driven simulations. The climate carbon-cycle feedbacks affect the transient climate response to emissions. Constraining this uncertainty is crucial for the assessment of remaining carbon budgets consistent with global mean temperature levels and is covered in Chapter 5 of this Report. Finally, there are uncertainties in future solar and volcanic forcing The relative magnitude of model uncertainty and internal variability depends on the time horizon of the"}

New literature published after the AR5 systematically discusses the role of different sources of uncertainty and shows that the relative contribution of internal variability is larger for short than for long projection horizons, larger for high latitudes than for low latitudes, larger for land than for ocean variables, larger at station level than continental than global means, larger for annual maxima/minima than for multi-decadal means, larger for dynamic quantities than for temperature. The method introduced by Hawkins and Sutton and applied to GSAT projections reveals that by the end of the 21st century, the fraction contribution of the climate model response uncertainty to the total uncertainty is larger in CMIP6 than in CMIP5 whereas the relative contribution of scenario uncertainty is smaller. This is the case even when sub-selecting pathways and scenarios that are most similar in CMIP5 and CMIP6, i.e. the range from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5 vs. SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8-5, respectively. The larger range of response uncertainty is further consistent with the larger range of TCR and GSAT warming for a comparable pathway in CMIP6 than CMIP5. Some uncertainties are not, or only partially accounted for in the CMIP6 experiments, such as uncertainties in natural forcings from solar and volcanic forcings, long-term Earth system feedbacks including land-ice feedbacks, groundwater feedbacks or some long-term carbon-cycle feedbacks. Where appropriate, this chapter uses results from non-CMIP ESMs or EMICs to assess the role of these feedbacks. Still other uncertainties  such as further pandemics, nuclear holocaust, global natural disaster such as tsunami or asteroid impact, or fundamental technological change such as fusion  are not accounted for at all. 4.2.6 Display of Model Agreement and Spread Maps of multi-model mean changes provide an average estimate for the forced model climate response to a certain forcing. However, they do not include any information on the robustness of the response across models nor on the significance of the change with respect to unforced internal variability. Models can consistently show absence of significant change, in which case they should not be expected to agree on the sign of a change. If a multi-model mean map of precipitation shows no change, it is unclear whether the models consistently project insignificant changes or whether projections span both significant increases and significant decreases. Several methods have been proposed to distinguish significant conflicting signals from agreement on no significant change. A set of different methods have been introduced in the literature to display model robustness and to put a climate change signal into the context of internal variability. AR5 Box 12.1 provides a detailed assessment of different methods of mapping model robustness and Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1 provides an update of recent proposals including the methods used in this report. Most methods for quantifying robustness assume that only one realization from each model is applied. There are challenges that arise from having heterogeneous multi-model ensembles with many members for some models and single members for others. Furthermore, the methods that map model robustness usually ignore that sharing parametrizations or entire components across coupled models can lead to substantial model interdependence. This may lead to a biased estimate of model agreement if a substantial fraction of models is interdependent. The methodologies and results in these literature since AR5 are higher in quality and clarity. However, quantifying and accounting for model dependence in a robust way remains challenging. Furthermore, absence of significant mean change in a certain climate variable does not imply absence of substantial impact, because there may be substantial change in variability, which is typically not mapped."}

Such model weighting was performed in the AR5 for projections of Arctic sea ice, but that particular application has subsequently been shown by Notz to be contaminated by internal variability, making the resulting weighting questionable (see also Stroeve and Notz). For a general cautionary note, see Weigel et al.. Approaches that take into account internal variability and model independence have been proposed since AR5. There are hence good reasons for basing an assessment of future global climate on lines of evidence in addition to the projection simulations. However, despite some progress, no universal, robust method for weighting a multi-model projection ensemble is available, and expert judgement must be included, as it did for AR5, in the assessment of the projections. The default in this chapter follows the AR5 approach for GSAT and interprets the CMIP6 595% ensemble range as the likely uncertainty range. Additional lines of evidence enter the assessment particularly for the most important indicator of global climate change, GSAT. The CMIP6 ensemble generally shows larger projected warming by the end of the 21st century, relative to the average over the period 19952014, than the CMIP5 ensemble. The warming has increased in part because of models with higher ECS in CMIP6, compared to CMIP5, and in part because of higher ERF in CMIP6 than in CMIP5. Because change in several other important climate quantities scales with change in GSAT, bringing in additional lines of evidence is particularly important for the GSAT assessment. The Chapter 4 assessment uses information from the following sources: The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble, augmented if appropriate by the CMIP5 ensemble. Single-model large initial-condition ensembles and combinations of control runs with CMIP transient simulations to characterize internal variability. Several analyses using multiple large ensembles have recently become available and add robustness to the results(Maher et al., 2021). Assessed best estimates, likely, and very likely ranges of ECS and TCR, from process understanding, warming in the instrumental record, paleoclimates, and emergent constraints. The ECS and TCR ranges are converted into GSAT ranges using as an emulator a two-layer energy balance model that is driven by the effective radiative forcing assessed in Chapter 7. Assuming for the ERF resulting from a doubling of the CO2 concentration, F2  CO2=4.0 W m-2, and using the socalled zero-layer approximation to the EBM permits a one-to-one translation of any pair of ECS and TCR into a pair of climate feedback parameter  and ocean heat uptake coefficient , using the simple equations =F2  CO2 ECS-1 and = F2  CO2 TCR-1  F2  CO2 ECS-1; see Chapter 7 for a detailed discussion).

SROCC further assessed that the probability of an ice-free Arctic in September for stabilized global warming of 1.5C and 2.0C is approximately 1% and 1035%, respectively. With regards to the model selection in AR5, model evaluation studies have since identified shortcomings of the CMIP5 models to match the observed distribution of sea-ice thickness in the Arctic and the observed evolution of albedo on seasonal scales. It was also found that many models deviation from observed sea ice cover climatology cannot be explained by internal variability, whereas the models deviation from observed sea ice cover trend can often be explained by internal variability. This hinders a selection of models according to their simulated trends, which additionally has been shown to only have a weak effect on the magnitude of simulated future trends. Based on results from the CMIP6 models, we conclude that on average the Arctic will become practically ice-free in September by the end of the 21st century under SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. Also, in the CMIP6 models, Arctic SIA in March decreases in the future, but to a much lesser degree, in percentage terms, than in September.

Studies focusing on the relationship of sea-ice extent and changes in external drivers have consistently found a much-reduced likelihood of a practically ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer for global warming of 1.5C than for 2.0C. This is shown here in a large initial-condition ensemble of observationally constrained model simulations where GSAT are stabilized at 1.5C, 2.0C and 3.0C warming relative to 18501900 in the RCP8.5 scenario. Temperature stabilization is achieved by switching off all the anthropogenic emissions around the time that GSAT first reaches the stabilization thresholds. Simulations have been observationally constrained to correct for a model bias in simulated historical September sea-ice extent. In these simulations, Arctic sea ice coverage in September is simulated, on average, to drop below 1 million km2 around 2040, consistent with the AR5 set of assessed models. The individual model simulations, for which there are twenty for each stabilized temperature level, show that the probability of the Arctic becoming practically ice free at the end of the 21st century is significantly higher for 2C warming than for 1.5C warming above 18501900 levels."}

Throughout this chapter, we use a simple fixed latitude-based NAM index defined as the difference in SLP between 35N and 65N. The NAM index computed from the latitudinal gradient in SLP is strongly correlated with variations in the latitudinal position and strength of the mid-latitude westerly jets, and with the spatial distribution of Arctic sea ice. Projected changes in the position and strength of the mid-latitude westerly jets, storm tracks, and atmospheric blocking in both hemispheres are assessed in Section 4.5.1.6. AR5 referred to the NAM, and its synonym the Arctic Oscillation, through its regional counterpart, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Here, we use the term NAM to refer also to the AO and NAO, accepting that the AO and NAO are not identical entities. We first summarise the assessment of past NAM changes and their attribution from Chapters 2 and 3 to put into context the future projections described here. Strong positive trends for the NAM/NAO indices were observed since 1960, which have weakened since the 1990s. The NAO variability in the instrumental record was likely not unusual in the millennial and multi-centennial context. Climate models simulate the gross features of the NAM with reasonable fidelity, including its interannual variability, but models tend to systematically underestimate the amount of multidecadal variability of the NAM and jet stream compared to observations; Chapter 3, Section 3.7.1), with the caveat of the observational record being relatively short to characterise decadal variability.

AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations that the future boreal wintertime NAM is very likely to exhibit large natural variations and trends of similar magnitude to that observed in the past and is likely to become slightly more positive in the future.

Significant progress has been made since AR5 in understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for changes in the NAM, although uncertainties remain. It is now clear from the literature that the NAM response, and the closely-related response of the mid-latitude storm tracks, to anthropogenic forcing in CMIP5-era climate models is determined by a tug-of-war between two opposing processes; 1) Arctic amplification, which decreases the low-level meridional temperature gradient, reduces baroclinicity on the poleward flank of the eddy-driven jet, and shifts the storm tracks equatorward and leading to a negative NAM; 2) and enhanced warming in the tropical upper-troposphere, due to GHG increases and associated water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks, which increases the upper-level meridional temperature gradient and causes a poleward shift of the storm tracks and a positive NAM. The large diversity in projected NAM changes in CMIP5 multi-model ensemble appears to be at least partly explained by the relative importance of these two mechanisms in particular models. Models that produce larger Arctic amplification also tend to produce larger equatorward shifts of the midlatitude jets and associated negative NAM responses. Another area of progress is new understanding the role of cloud radiative effects in shaping the mid-latitude circulation response to anthropogenic forcing. Through their non-uniform distribution of radiative heating, cloud changes can modify meridional temperature gradients and alter mid-latitude circulation and the annular modes in both hemispheres. In addition to the effects of changing upper and lower tropospheric temperature gradients on the NAM, progress has been made since AR5 in understanding the effect of simulated changes in the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex on winter NAM projections."}

In its positive phase, the SAM characterizes anomalously low pressure over the polar cap and high pressure in southern mid-latitudes. While there are some zonal asymmetries to the structure of the SAM, it is more symmetric than its NH counterpart. Throughout this chapter, we use a simple fixed latitude-based SAM index defined as the difference in zonal mean SLP between 40S and 65S. Although the SAM is often used as a proxy for the location of the mid-latitude westerly wind belt, trends in the SAM can reflect a combination of changes in jet position, width, and strength. The changes in the SH circulation associated with the SAM influence on surface wind stress and hence affect the Southern Ocean. Over the instrumental period, there has been a robust positive trend in the SAM index, particularly since 1970. There is medium confidence that the recent trend in the SAM is unprecedented in the past several Centuries. There is high confidence that stratospheric ozone depletion and GHG increases have contributed to the positive SAM trend during the late 20th century, with ozone depletion dominating in austral summer, following the peak of the Antarctic ozone hole in SeptemberOctober, and GHG increases dominating in other seasons. To capture the effects of stratospheric ozone changes on the SAM, climate models must include a realistic representation of ozone variations. In models that do not explicitly represent stratospheric ozone chemistry, which includes the majority of the CMIP6 model ensemble, an ozone dataset is prescribed. To properly capture the effects of ozone depletion and recovery on the stratosphere and surface climate, the prescribed ozone dataset must realistically capture observed stratospheric ozone trends with sufficiently high temporal resolution. The CMIP6 experiment protocol recommended the use of a prescribed 4-D monthly mean ozone concentration field for models without stratospheric chemistry. AR5 assessed that the positive trend in the austral summer/autumn SAM observed since 1970 is likely to weaken considerably as stratospheric ozone recovers through the mid-21st century, while in other seasons the SAM changes depend on the emission scenario, with a larger increase in SAM for higher emission scenarios. In CMIP6 models, the austral summer SAM is more positive by the end of the 21st century under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. On the other hand, under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, the SAM is projected to be less positive, especially under SSP1-1.9 where the 595% ranges of anomalies relative to 19952014 are 3.1 to 0.0 hPa averaged from 20812100. In summary, under the highest emission scenarios in the CMIP6 models, the SAM in the austral summer becomes more positive through the 21st century. 4.3.3.2 El Nino-Southern Oscillation ENSO is the most dominant mode of variability on interannual timescales and also the dominant source of seasonal climate predictability.

However, they assessed there was low confidence in projected changes in ENSO variability in the 21st century due to a strong component of internal variability.

Anomalies in NHSM circulation index, defined as the vertical shear of zonal winds between 850 and 200 hPa averaged in a zone stretching from Mexico eastward to the Philippines in the CMIP6 historical simulation and five SSPs. One realization is averaged from each model. Anomalies are shown relative to the present-day mean. The curves show averages over the simulations, the shadings around the SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 curves show 595% ranges, and the numbers near the top show the number of model simulations used. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. In AR5, there was no specific assessment on global monsoon changes in the near term, but information can be derived from CMIP5 projections of the spatial patterns of precipitation change. While the basic pattern of wet regions including global monsoon regions tending to get wetter and dry regions tending to get drier is apparent, large response uncertainty is evident in the substantial spread in the magnitude of projected change simulated by different simulations. Over the global land monsoon regions, model uncertainty and internal variability together explain 99.7% of the fraction of total variance, near-term projected multi-model mean precipitation changes are almost everywhere smaller than the estimated standard deviation of internal variability. The global land monsoon precipitation index, defined as the area-weighted precipitation rate in the global land monsoon domain, tends to increase in the near term under all five core SSPs, but changes are small compared to the intermodel spread in the historical period. The Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon circulation index, defined as the vertical shear of zonal winds between 850 and 200 hPa averaged in a zone stretching from Mexico eastward to the Philippines, tends to decrease under four of the five SSP scenarios, potentially offsetting monsoon precipitation increase. Projected changes in the global monsoon circulation are also uncertain influenced by internal variability and structural differences across models. In the near-term, for CMIP6 projections, the multi-model mean of global land monsoon precipitation change is 1.9%, 1.6%, 1.3%, and 1.9% under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. In summary, we assess that near-term changes in global monsoon precipitation and circulation will be affected by the combined effects of model uncertainty and internal variability, which together are larger than the forced signal. 4.4.2 Cryosphere, Ocean, and Biosphere 4.4.2.1 Arctic Sea Ice AR5 assessed that for RCP8.5, Arctic sea-ice coverage in September will drop below 1 million km2, or become practically ice-free, at some point between 2040 and 2060.

Hence, no robust change in amplitude of ENSO SST and rainfall variability is expected in the near term although the rainfall variability slightly increases. 4.4.3.3 Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole Modes. Important modes of interannual climate variability with pronounced climate impacts in the Africa-IndoPacific areas of the globe are the Indian Ocean Dipole, which is closely related toand often coincides with ENSO phases, and the Indian Ocean Basin mode, which is often described as a capacitor effect in response to ENSO and can feed back onto ENSO evolution. IOD and IOB are extensively described in Annex IV, Section AIV2.4. The projected climate mean state changes in the tropical Indian Ocean resemble a positive IOD state, with faster warming in the west compared to the east. This mean state change will potentially lead to a reduction in the amplitude of IOD events, albeit with no robust change in IOD frequency. There is no robust evidence yet suggesting a cessation of IOD variability or a significant change in the IOB mode in the near-term. 4.4.3.4 Tropical Atlantic Modes Interannual variability of the tropical Atlantic can be described in terms of two main climate modes: the Atlantic Equatorial Mode and the Atlantic Meridional Mode. The Atlantic Equatorial Mode, also commonly referred to as the Atlantic Nino or Atlantic Zonal Mode, is associated with SST anomalies near the equator, peaking in the eastern basin, while the AMM is characterized by an inter-hemispheric gradient of SST and wind anomalies. Both modes are associated with changes in the ITCZ and related winds and exert a strong influence on the climate in adjacent and remote regions. Despite considerable improvements in CMIP5 with respect to CMIP3, most CMIP5 models have difficulties in simulating the mean climate of the tropical Atlantic and are not able to correctly simulate the main aspects of Tropical Atlantic Variability and associated impacts. This is presumably the main reason why there is a lack of specific studies dealing with near-term changes in tropical Atlantic modes. Nevertheless, AR5 reported that the ocean is more predictable than continental areas at the decadal timescale. In particular, the predictability in the tropical oceans is mainly associated with decadal variations of the external forcing component. Since the AMV affects the tropical Atlantic, nearterm variations of the AMV can modulate the Equatorial Mode and the AMM as well as associated impacts. There are no specific studies focusing on near-term changes in tropical Atlantic modes; nevertheless, decadal predictions show that although the North Atlantic stands out in most CMIP5 models as the primary region where skill might be improved because of initialization, encouraging results have also been found in the tropical Atlantic. The effect of initialization in the tropical Atlantic is not only visible in surface temperature but also in the subsurface ocean. In particular, initialization improves the skill via remote ocean conditions in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre and tropical Pacific, which influence the tropical Atlantic through atmospheric teleconnections. Improvements of some aspects of climate prediction systems have also led to skill improvements over the tropical Atlantic. Recent studies have shown that the AMV can modulate not only the characteristics of the Atlantic Ninos, but also their inter-basin teleconnections. In particular, the Atlantic NinoENSO relationship is strongest during negative AMV phases when equatorial Atlantic SST variability is enhanced (Martin-Rey et al., 2017; Lubbecke et"}

Based on CMIP5 and available CMIP6 results, we conclude that there is a lack of studies on the near-term evolution of TAV and associated teleconnections for a comprehensive assessment. However, some studies show that despite severe model biases there are skilful predictions in the mean state of tropical Atlantic surface temperature several years ahead, though skill in simulated variability has not been assessed yet. Decadal changes in the Atlantic Nino spatial configuration and associated teleconnections might be modulated by the AMV, but there is limited evidence and therefore low confidence in these results. 4.4.3.5 Pacific Decadal Variability Climate variability of the Pacific Ocean on decadal and interdecadal timescales is described in terms of a number of quasi-oscillatory SST patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, which are referred to as the Pacific Decadal Variability. PDV comprises an inter-hemispheric pattern that varies at decadal-to-interdecadal timescales. However, although the spatial domains to derive the IPO and PDO indices differ, and despite uncertainty related to trend removal and time-filtering, the IPO and PDO are highly correlated in time and they will be assessed together as the PDV. AR5 assessed that near-term predictions of PDV were largely model dependent, not robust to sampling of initialization start-dates, overall not statistically significant, and worse than persistence, although some studies showed positive skill for PDV. The CMIP5 decadal-prediction ensemble yielded no prediction skill of SST over the key PDV centres of action in the Pacific Ocean, both at 25 year and 69 year forecast averages. Since AR5, the processes causing the multi-decadal variability in the Pacific Ocean have become better understood(Henley, 2017). However, the relative importance of tropical and extratropical processes underlying PDV remains unclear; although it seems to be stochastically driven rather than self-excited, the South Pacific being a key region for the tropical branch of PDV. Because PDV represents not one, but many dynamical processes, it represents a challenge as a target for near-term climate predictions and projections. The new generation of decadal forecast systems keeps showing poor to moderate multi-year prediction skill for PDV, although the potential for forecasting capabilities is demonstrated in case studies. For the near-term, a transition of PDV from the negative phase towards a positive phase is predicted in the coming years. The PDV has been shown to influence the pace of global warming, but the extent to which PDV is externally forced or internally generated remains an open question, and there is still no robust evidence. Thus, there is low confidence on how the PDV will evolve in the near-term. 4.4.3.6 Atlantic Multidecadal Variability The Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability is a large-scale climate mode accounting for the main fluctuations in North Atlantic SST on multi-decadal timescales. The AMV influences air temperatures and precipitation over adjacent and remote continents, and its undulations can partially explain the observed variations in the NH mean temperatures. The origin of this variability is still uncertain. Ocean dynamics, external forcing, and local"}

Recent studies have discussed that the ocean dynamics play an active role in generating AMV and its interplay with the NAO, although natural and anthropogenic external forcing might be crucial in modulating its amplitude and timing(Bellomo et al., 2018; Andrews et al., 2020; Borchert et al., 2021)(Mann et al., 2021). AR5 assessed with high confidence that initialized predictions can improve the skill for temperature over the North Atlantic, in particular in the sub-polar branch of AMV, compared to the projections, for the first five years. However, non-initialized predictions showed positive correlation over the same time-range as well, consistent with the notion that part of this variability is caused by external forcing. Since AR5, near-term initialized predictions, both multi-model and single-model ensembles(Simpson et al., 2018c)(Yeager et al., 2018)(Hermanson et al., 2020)(Bilbao et al., 2021), confirm substantial skill in hindcasting North-Atlantic SST anomalies on a time range of 810 years. On the same time range, show a substantial improvement in the prediction of the subpolar gyre SST in CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5, in both initialized and non-initialized simulations. The higher skill can be attributed to a more accurate response in CMIP6 models to natural forcing, possibly originating from the AMOC-related delayed response to volcanic eruptions, which contribute to the SST variations in the subpolar gyre. Initialization contributes to the reduction of uncertainty and to predicting subpolar SST amplitude. Yet, skill in predicting the AMV is not always translated into equally successful predictions of temperature and precipitation over the nearby land and ocean regions. This might be related to systematic model errors in the simulation of the spatial and temporal structure of the AMV and too weak associated teleconnections, and also to the larger noise in regional land variables compared to the AMV index. However, AMV predictions can be used as proxies to predict other variables such as precipitation over Western Europe and Eurasia and SAT over Mediterranean, northern Europe and northeast Asia whose relationship with North Atlantic SST is robust in observations, but not well captured in climate models. Encouraging results about the prediction of land precipitation linked to the warm AMV phase on a 2-9 year timescale are reported in the multi-model study by. Positive correlations with observations are found in the Sahel, South America, the Maritime Continent. Analyses from large-ensemble decadal prediction systems such as the community Earth system model decadal prediction large ensemble show an improvement with respect to the CMIP5 decadal hindcasts in forecasting Sahel precipitation over three to seven years, which is consistent with the current understanding of AMV impact over Africa. CESM-DPLE predicts drought conditions over the Sahel through 2020, which is compatible with a shift towards a negative phase of AMV as a result of a weakening of the AMOC, advocated by a number of studies. In summary, the confidence in the predictions of AMV and its effects is medium. However, there is high confidence that the AMV skill over 58-year lead times is improved by using initialized predictions, compared to non-initialized simulations. 4.4.4 Response to Short-Lived Climate Forcers and Volcanic Eruptions Mitigation of SLCFs affects future climate projections and could alter the time of emergence of anthropogenic climate change signals.

The changes in SLCF emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a small net radiative forcing without a discernible impact on GSAT. SLCF mitigation also leads to a higher GSAT in the midto long-term and can influence peak warming during the 21st century. This section focuses on the total effect of SLCF changes on GSAT projections in the SSP scenarios. A more detailed breakdown of the separate climate effects of SLCF species and precursor species can be found in Sections 6.7.2 and 6.7.3. A model experiment based on the SSP3-7.0 scenario with aerosols, their precursors, and non-methane tropospheric ozone precursors set to SSP1-1.9 abundances shows a projected multi-model mean GSAT anomaly that is higher by 0.22oC at mid-century compared to SSP3-7.0, but this difference is smaller than the intermodel spread of the SSP3-7.0 projections based on the CMIP6 models. Note the SSP3-7.0-lowSLCFhighCH4 experiment does not perturb methane from SSP3-7.0 concentrations. A modified SSP3-7.0lowSLCF-lowCH4 scenario that also includes methane mitigation shows a lower GSAT by mid-century compared to SSP3-7.0. Figure 4.18: Influence of SLCFs on projected GSAT change. Change is shown relative to the 19952014 average and relative to the 18501900 average. The comparison is for CMIP6 models for the AerChemMIP SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH4 experiment, where concentrations of short-lived species are reduced compared to reference SSP3-7.0 scenario. The curves show averages over the r1 simulations contributed to the CMIP6 exercise, the shadings around the SSP3-7.0 curve shows 595% ranges and the numbers near the top show the number of model simulations. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. Building on CMIP6 results for the effects of reducing SLCF emissions from a baseline of SSP3-7.0, the overall contribution of SLCFs to GSAT changes in the marker SSPs are now quantified using a simple climate model emulator. For consistency with Section 6.7.2 and Figure 6.22, the basket of SLCF compounds considered includes aerosols, ozone, methane, black carbon on snow and hydrofluorocarbons with lifetimes of less than 50 years. In the five marker SSPs considered, the net effect of SLCFs contributes to a higher GSAT in the near, midand long term. In the SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios, SLCFs contribute to a higher GSAT by a central estimate of around 0.3 C compared to 199542 2014 across the three-time horizons. In the long-term, the 0.3 C warming due to SLCFs in SSP1-2.6 can be compared to the assessed very likely GSAT change for this period of 0.51.5 C. The SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios all show a larger SLCF effect on GSAT in the long term relative to the near term. In SSP3-7.0, the long-term warming due to SLCFs by 0.7 C can be compared with the assessed very likely GSAT anomaly for this period of 2.03.7 C. In summary, it is very likely that changes in SLCFs contribute to an overall warmer GSAT over the near, midand long term in the five SSP scenarios considered.

The additional warming at high northern latitudes associated with projected reductions in aerosol emissions over the 21st century leads to a more rapid reduction in Arctic sea-ice extent in the RCP scenarios. Furthermore, mitigation of non-methane SLCFs in the SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH4 scenario causes an increase in global mean precipitation, with larger regional changes in southern and eastern Asia. The main uncertainties in climate effects of SLCFs in the future come from: the uncertainty in anthropogenic aerosol ERF; uncertainty in the relative emissions of different SLCFs that have warming and cooling effects in the current climate; and physical uncertainty including the efficacy of the climate response to SLCFs compared to long-lived GHGs. One example of physical uncertainty is that the shortwave radiative forcing from methane was neglected in previous calculations, which affects understanding of present-day and future methane ERF. Another example of physical uncertainty is projected changes in lightning-NOx production, which contributes to future ozone radiative forcing. Another factor that could substantially alter projections in the near-term would be the occurrence of a large explosive volcanic eruption, or even a decadal to multi-decadal sequence of small-to-moderate volcanic eruptions as witnessed over the early 21st century. An eruption similar to the last large tropical eruption, Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991, is expected to cause substantial Northern Hemisphere cooling, peaking between 0.09C and 0.38C and lasting for three to five years, as indicated by climate model simulations over the past millennium. Phase 3 of Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project simulated a significant NH cooling in response to individual volcanic events that lasts for three to five years. On a regional scale, the double volcanic events that occurred in 536 and 540 CE resulted in a cooling of 2C. Since AR5, there has been growing progress in understanding the climate impacts of volcanic eruptions. Volcanic forcing is regarded as the dominant driver of forced variability in preindustrial surface air temperature. Large eruptions in the tropics and high latitudes were primary drivers of interannual-to-decadal temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere during the past 2,500 years, with cooling persisting for up to ten years after some of the largest eruptive episodes. Repeated clusters of volcanic eruptions can induce a net negative radiative forcing that results in a centennial and global scale cooling trend via a decline in mixed-layer oceanic heat content (McGregor et al.,"}

The general pattern of change indicates that high latitude land masses are likely to experience greater amounts of precipitation due to the increased specific humidity of the warmer troposphere as well as increased transport of water vapour from the tropics by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Many mid-latitude and subtropical arid and semi-arid regions will likely experience less precipitation and many moist mid-latitude regions will likely experience more precipitation by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Since AR5, progress has been achieved in understanding changes in patterns and rates of precipitation with GSAT rise. The projected precipitation changes can be decomposed into a part that is related to atmospheric circulation referred to as dynamical component and a part related to water vapour changes, the thermodynamic component. Based on process understanding and modelling, global mean precipitation will very likely increase by 13% per C of GSAT warming. The increase in atmospheric water vapour is a robust change under global warming, the sensitivity of global precipitation change to warming is smaller as compared to water vapour change. Global energy balance places a strong constraint on the global mean precipitation. Tropospheric radiative cooling constrains global precipitation, leading to a slow SST-dependent response and a forcing-dependent rapid adjustment. Rapid adjustments account for large regional differences in hydrological sensitivity across multiple drivers. The rapid regional precipitation response to increased CO2 is robust across models, implying that the uncertainty in long-term changes is mainly associated with the response to SST-mediated feedbacks. Precipitation response to fast adjustments and slow temperature-driven responses are assessed in detail in Chapter 8 Section 8.2.1. The thermodynamic response to global warming is associated with a wet-get-wetter mechanism, with enhanced moisture flux leading to subtropical dry regions getting drier and tropical and mid-latitude wet regions getting wetter. Recent studies suggest that the dry-getdrier argument does not hold, especially over subtropical land regions. The discrepancy may be partly arising due to differences in model climatologies and by change in the location of wet and dry regions. Over the 21st century, significant rate of precipitation change is associated with a spatial stabilization and intensification of moistening and drying patterns. In the tropics, weakening of circulation leads to a wet-gets-drier and dry-gets-wetter pattern. Climate model agreement for precipitation change in the tropics is lower than for other regions. Sources of inter-model uncertainty in regional rainfall projections arise from circulation changes and spatial shifts in convection and convergence, associated with SST pattern change and landsea thermal contrast change with a secondary contribution from the response to direct CO2 forcing. Factors governing changes in large-scale precipitation patterns are assessed in detail in Section 8.2.2 and Section 10.4.1. Long-term multi-model mean change in seasonal precipitation from CMIP6 models shows substantial regional differences and seasonal contrast. Changes in seasonal precipitation under SSP1-2.6 are small compared to internal variability. Consistent with the AR5, patterns of precipitation change show very likely increase in the high latitudes especially during local winter and over tropical oceanoceans under SSP3-7.0. CMIP6 projections show an increase in precipitation over larger parts of the monsoon regions and decreases in many subtropical regions including the Mediterranean, southern Africa and southwest Australia.

In all RCP scenarios, the global monsoon area is very likely to increase, and the global monsoon precipitation intensity is likely to increase, resulting in a very likely increase in the global monsoon total precipitation, by 20812100. Since AR5, there has been progress in understanding physical mechanisms for the projected changes in global monsoon and quantifying the sources of uncertainty in projections. The increase in global monsoon precipitation under warming is primarily attributed to the increase of moisture convergence, which comes mainly from the thermodynamic effect due to increasing atmospheric moisture but is partly offset by reduced convergence. The dynamic effect, such as monsoon circulation changes, dominates regional differences in the projected monsoon precipitation changes. Specifically, NH monsoon precipitation will increase more strongly than its SH counterpart, due to an increase in hemispheric temperature difference between the NH and SH, enhancement of the Hadley circulation, and atmospheric moistening, countered by stabilization of the troposphere. The seasonality of global monsoon rainfall is projected to enhance in response to warming, featuring a greater wet-dry season contrast. In addition, the interannual variability of global monsoon rainfall is projected to intensify mainly over land, with a strengthened relationship between global monsoon and ENSO. For the uncertainty in mean monsoon precipitation projections, the model uncertainty is the dominant contributor throughout the century and explains more than 70% of the inter-model variance during near term, mid-term, and long term. The contribution of internal variability is only important at the beginning in early decades, while scenario uncertainty becomes important at the end of the 21st century. The sources of uncertainty for the mean and extreme monsoon precipitation mainly differ in the long-term projection, when the contribution of scenario uncertainty is comparable to the model uncertainty for extreme precipitation. Although the magnitude of internal variability differs between CMIP5 models and single-model initial-condition large ensembles, the impact is only evident in the beginning decades. For the midand long term, the magnitude difference does not alter that model uncertainty is the dominant source of uncertainty in the projections of global land monsoon precipitation. Based on the projections of changes in precipitation from CMIP6 under the four SSPs, the global monsoon precipitation is likely to strengthen in the 21st century with increases in its intensity, while NH summer monsoon circulation weakens. Global land monsoon precipitation will likely increase by 1.332 2.4 % per C GSAT warming among the four scenarios considered here. In the long term, the multi-model mean change of global land monsoon precipitation index is 2.9%, 3.7%, 3.77%, and 5.7% under SSP12.6, SSP235 4.5, SSP37.0, and SSP58.5, respectively. This enhancement is caused by thermodynamic responses due to increased moisture, which is partly offset by dynamic responses due to a weakened circulation. The patterns of monsoon rainfall changes in the midto long-term include a NorthSouth asymmetry characterized by greater increase in the NH than the SH, and an EastWest asymmetry characterized by enhanced Asian-African monsoons and weakened North American monsoon. Based on the assessment of CMIP6 models, we conclude that it is likely that, in the midto long term, the global land monsoon precipitation will increase with GSAT rise despite a weakened monsoon circulation. The global land monsoon precipitation will likely increase by 1.32.4 % per C GSAT warming among the four scenarios. Monsoon precipitation responses depend on region and emission scenario. 4.5.1.6 Sea Level Pressure, Large-scale Atmospheric Circulation, Storm Tracks and Blocking This subsection provides a global overview of long-term changes in atmospheric dynamical features that is complementary to the regional assessment of links to the hydrological cycle in Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2, and assessment of the connections to extreme events in Chapter 11, Section 11.7.2.

Such a pattern is associated with a poleward shift in the storm track and an increase in the annular mode index. This broad pattern is also found in CMIP6 models. Under SSP1-2.6, the pattern in sea level pressure change resembles that for SSP3-7.0, but the amplitudes are small compared to internal variability in 20-year means. One exception is found in the SH mid-latitudes, where pressure robustly increases in SSP3-7.0 in both austral summer and winter, but shows no robust change in SSP1-2.6. This is likely attributable to the larger GHG forcing in SSP3-7.0 compared to SSP1-2.6, which contributes to a poleward shift of the SH mid-latitude circulation and becomes relatively more important than the effect of ozone recovery which drives an equatorward shift in the circulation. The poleward shift in SH mid-latitude circulation in SSP3-7.0 likely contributes to the wetting trend at high southern latitudes. As was found in AR5, several regional sea level pressure features stand out from the zonal-mean change. Sea level pressure markedly decreases in northeastern North America and northeastern Asia in boreal winter. In boreal summer, sea level pressure robustly decreases in the Mediterranean and the Middle-East, a decrease that has been linked to a large-scale heat low forced by the amplified warming of the region. It is likely that sea level pressure will increase across the southwestern North America and Central America in boreal summer under SSP3-7.0 due to an intensification of the eastern North Pacific subtropical summer high and a weakening of the North American monsoon(Pascale et al., 2017)(see Section 4.5.1.5). These changes in circulation are connected to drying across the eastern subtropical Pacific and Central America regions. Figure 4.25: Long-term change of seasonal mean sea level pressure.

Zonal wind and westerly jets Storm tracks and mid-latitude westerly jets are dynamically related aspects of mid-latitude circulation. AR5 assessed that a poleward shift of the SH westerlies and storm track is likely by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5. In contrast, low confidence was assessed for the storm-track response in the NH. Under both SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 there is a strengthening and lifting of the subtropical jets in both hemispheres, consistent with the response to large-scale tropospheric warming found in earlier generations of climate models. In the SH, GHG emissions tend to force a poleward shift of the jet, but this is opposed, particularly in austral summer, by the stratospheric ozone hole recovery. Consistent with sea level pressure changes, CMIP6 models project a strengthening and poleward shift of the SH jet in austral summer and winter under SSP3-7.0, but smaller and non-robust changes in SH mid-latitude zonal winds under SSP1-2.6"}

CMIP6 models show an improved simulation of the SH jet stream latitude. This has been linked to a reduction in the projected poleward shift of the SH jet in austral summer compared to the CMIP5 models, although differences in the pattern of SST response may also play a role. In the NH extratropics, the changes in lower tropospheric zonal mean zonal winds by the end of the century are generally smaller than in the SH. In boreal winter, there is a weak poleward shift of the NH zonal mean westerly jet maximum in SSP3-7.0. CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show a strong seasonal and regional dependence in the response to climate change of NH westerlies. CMIP5 projections indicate a poleward shift of the westerlies in the North Atlantic in boreal summer, while the North Pacific jet weakens in this season. There is a poleward shift in the westerlies in both the North Pacific and North Atlantic in Autumn. However, the shift of the westerlies is more uncertain in the other seasons particularly in the North Atlantic in winter. Here, the circulation response is not well described as a simple shift, since the North Atlantic jet tends to be squeezed on both its equatorward and poleward flanks, together with an eastward extension into Europe. Simulations indicate that most of the changes in winter storminess over the Euro-Atlantic region will occur only after exceeding the 1.5C warming level. Figure 4.26: Long-term change of zonal mean zonal wind. Dispayed are multi-model mean change in boreal winter and austral winter zonal mean zonal wind in 20812100 for SSP12.6 and SSP3-7.0 relative to 19952014.

Crossed lines indicate regions where less than 80% of the models agree on the sign of the change and no overlay where at least 80% of the models agree on the sign of the change. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. Progress since AR5 has improved understanding of the climate change aspects that can drive these different, and potentially opposite, responses in the mid-latitude jets and storm tracks. A poleward shift of the jets and storm tracks is expected in response to an increase in the atmospheric stratification and in the uppertropospheric equator-to-pole meridional temperature gradient, while it is opposed by the decrease in the meridional temperature gradient in the lower troposphere associated with the polar amplification of global warming. Recent analyses have identified additional climate aspects that can drive mid-latitude jet changes, including patterns in sea surface warming, land-sea warming contrast, loss of sea ice(Deser et al., 2015)(Harvey et al., 2015)(Screen et al., 2018b), and changes in the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex(Manzini et al., 2014)(Grise and Polvani, 2017)(Ceppi and Shepherd, 2019a). From an energetics perspective, the uncertainty in the response of the jet streams depends on the response of clouds, their non-spatially uniform radiative feedbacks shaping the meridional profile of warming. Climate models seem to underestimate the forced component of the year-to-year variability in the atmospheric circulation, particularly in the North Atlantic sector, which suggests some relevant dynamical processes may not be well represented. Whether and how this may affect long-term projections is unknown. In conclusion, due to the influence from competing dynamical drivers and the absence of observational evidence, there is medium confidence in a projected poleward shift of the NH zonal-mean low-level westerlies in autumn and summer and low confidence in the other seasons. There is also overall low confidence in projected regional changes in the NH low-level westerlies, particularly for the"}

Considerable uncertainty is related to physical mechanisms to explain the observed and projected changes in the NAM, but NAM trends are clearly closely connected to projected shifts in the mid-latitude jets and storm tracks. NAM projections from climate models analysed since AR5 reveal broadly similar results the late 21st century. CMIP6 models show a positive ensemble-mean trend in most seasons and the higher emission scenarios that is comparable to between-model or between-realization variability. The NAM generally becomes more positive by the end of the century except in boreal summer when there is no change in the NAM in these simulations. In boreal winter under SSP5-8.5, the central estimate is an increase in the NAM by almost 3 hPa in the long-term compared to 19952014. This can be compared to a multi-model mean interannual standard deviation in the winter NAM index of 3.4 hPa during the period 18501900. We conclude with high confidence that in the midto long-term, the boreal wintertime surface NAM is more positive under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, while under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, the NAM does not show any robust change. The Southern Annular Mode AR5 assessed it is likely that the evolution of the SAM over the 21st century will be primarily determined by the interplay between the effects of ozone recovery and changing GHG concentrations and influence the SAM in opposing ways. Owing to the relative effects of these two drivers, CMIP5 model SAM and SH circulation projections differed markedly across forcing scenarios and across seasons. CMIP5 models simulated a weak negative SAM trend in austral summer for RCP4.5 by the end of the century, while for RCP8.5 they simulated a weak positive SAM trend in austral summer. A substantial fraction of the spread in CMIP5 projections of the end of century SH summer jet shift under RCP8.5 may be attributable to differences in the simulated change in break-up of the stratospheric polar vortex, with models that produce a later break-up date showing a larger summertime poleward jet shift. For RCP2.6, the effect of ozone recovery on the SAM has been found to dominate over that of GHGs in austral summer. In austral winter, the poleward shift of the SH circulation in CMIP5 models, and the associated increase in the SAM index, tends to be larger, on average, in higher forcing scenarios though with substantial inter-model spread. New research since the AR5 shows that the previous theory for the apparent relationship across models between the annual mean climatological SH jet position and the amplitude of forced SH jet shift does not hold at seasonal timescales. In most seasons, the SAM becomes more positive by the end of the century relative to 19952014 under SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. Conversely, under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, in most seasons the SAM index does not show a robust change compared to 19952014 except in austral summer when it becomes significantly more negative. The greatest change in the SAM occurs in austral winter,"}

Moreover, due to increased moisture availability, the associated precipitation variability on regional scales was assessed to likely intensify. An eastward shift in the patterns of temperature and precipitation variations in the North Pacific and North America related to El Nino and La Nina teleconnections was projected with medium confidence. The stability of teleconnections to other regional implications including those in Central and South America, the Caribbean, parts of Africa, most of Asia, Australia and most Pacific Islands were assessed to be uncertain. There is no consensus on changes in amplitude of ENSO SST variability across CMIP iterations. The main factors driving the diversity of ENSO SST amplitude change in climate models are internal variability, SST mean warming pattern, and model systematic biases. First, pronounced low-frequency modulations of ENSO exist even in unforced control simulations due to internal variability, which leads a large uncertainty in quantifying future ENSO changes. Second, ENSO characteristics depend on the climate mean state of the tropical Pacific; however, ENSO can also influence the mean state through nonlinear processes. The response of the tropical Pacific mean state to anthropogenic forcing is characterized by a faster warming on the equator compared to the off-equatorial region, a faster warming of the eastern equatorial Pacific compared to the central tropical Pacific, and a weakening of the Walker circulation in most models. Those models with a El Nino-like warming tend to project a strengthening of ENSO SST variability whereas models with a La Nina-like warming tend to project a weakening of variability. Third, how to take model biases into account leads to different ENSO changes. suggested that a subset of CMIP5 models that simulate linear ENSO stability realistically exhibit a decrease in ENSO amplitude by the second half of the 21st century. However, an increase of ENSO SST variability has been projected when considering biases in ENSO pattern simulation by different models. This highlights the importance of constraining tropical Pacific mean state changes in order to enhance confidence in the projected response of ENSO. There is also no robust consensus on changes in ENSO diversity. Several studies suggest that an increase in Eastern Pacific-ENSO events tends to be projected particularly in the models with an El Nino-like warming. However, Freund et al. suggested that models with a El Nino-like mean warming show a tendency toward more Central Pacific events but fewer EP events compared to models with an La Nina-like warming in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models."}

The models that best represent the Atlantic meridional mode show a weakening for future climate conditions. However, model biases in representation of Altantic Ninos strongly limit an assessment of future changes. Long-term changes in TAVs and associated teleconnections are expected as a result of global warming, but large uncertainties exist due to the models systematic underestimation of the connection between PDV and Indo-Pacific SST variations. Observational analyses show large discrepancies in SST and trade winds strength. Singlemodel sensitivity experiments show that Atlantic Nino characteristics at the end of 21st century remain consistent with those of the 20th century, though changes in the climatological SSTs can lead to changes in the associated teleconnections. The weakening of the AMOC expected from global warming has been suggested to have an influence on the mean background state of tropical-Atlantic surface conditions, thereby enhancing equatorial Atlantic variability and resulting in a stronger tropical AtlanticENSO teleconnection. A recent multi-model study, based on CMIP5, concluded that the TAV-Pacific teleconnection will weaken under global warming due to the increased thermal stability of the atmosphere. However, there is still a clear lack of model studies, and hence no robust evidence on the long-term evolution of TAV and associated teleconnections. 4.5.3.5 Pacific Decadal Variability AR5 assessed that there is low confidence in projections of future changes in Pacific decadal variability due to the inability of CMIP5 models to represent the connection between PDV and Indo-Pacific SST variations. Because the PDV appears to encompass the combined effects of different dynamical processes operating at different timescales, representation of PDV in climate models remains a challenge and its long-term evolution under climate change uncertain. In addition to uncertainty from the future evolution of the mechanisms that determined the PDV, it is also unclear how the background state in the Pacific Ocean will change due to time-varying radiative forcing, and how this change will interact with variability at interannual and low-frequency timescales. Recent research suggests that the PDV will have a weaker amplitude and higher frequency with global warming. The former appears to be associated with a decrease in SST variability and the meridional gradient over the Kuroshio-Oyashio region, with a reduction in North Pacific wind stress and meandering of the subpolar/subtropical gyre interplay. The latter is hypothesized to rely on the enhanced ocean stratification and shallower mixed layers of a warmer climate, which would increase the phase speed of the westwardpropagating oceanic waves, hence shortening the decadal-interdecadal component. The weakening of the PDV in a warmer climate may reduce the internal variability of global mean surface temperature, to which PDV seems associated. Thus, a weaker and higher frequency PDV could reduce the contribution of internal variability to the GSAT trend and eventually lead to a reduced probability of surface-warming hiatus events. In summary, based on CMIP5, there is medium confidence that a weaker and higher frequency PDV is expected under global warming. 4.5.3.6 Atlantic Multidecadal Variability"}

The temperature thresholds are not exceeded in all the model simulations across the Tier 1 SSPs, that is, decreasing numbers of simulations are available for the analysis of patterns of change as the temperature threshold increases. For each simulation within which a given temperature threshold is exceeded, a 20-year global climatology is subsequently constructed to represent that level of global warming, centred on the year for which the threshold was first exceeded. The composite of all such climatologies across the Tier 1 SSPs and model simulations constitute the spatial patterns of change for a given temperature threshold. Some of the complexities of scaling patterns of climate change with different levels of global warming are also discussed in the following sections. These include overshoot versus stabilization scenarios and limitations of pattern scaling for strong mitigation and stabilization scenarios. At least for the case of annual mean temperature and precipitation, strong evidence exists that even for strong mitigation and stabilization scenarios, patterns of change at lower levels of warming scale similarly to those reconstructed from transient simulations using either standard patterncorrelation or time-shift methodologies. Pattern scaling performance based on scenario experiments is generally better for near-surface temperature than for precipitation. For precipitation, rapid adjustments due to different forcing agents must be accounted for. Possible non-linear responses to different forcing levels are also important. Pattern scaling does not work as well at high forcing levels. It is also important to distinguish the forced response from internal variability when comparing similar warming levels. The purpose of this section is not to repeat the analysis for all the variables considered in Sections 4.4 and 4.5, but rather to show a selected number of key variables that are important from the perspective of understanding the response of the physical climate system to different levels of warming. 4.6.1.1 Temperature Global warming of 1.5C implies higher mean temperatures compared to 18501900, with generally higher warming over land compared to ocean areas and larger warming in high latitudes compared to low latitudes. In addition, global warming of 2C versus 1.5C results in robust increases in the mean temperatures in almost all locations, both on land and in the ocean, with subsequent further warming at almost all locations at higher levels of global warming. For each particular level of global warming, relatively larger mean warming is projected for land regions. The projected changes at 1.5C and 2C global warming are consistent with observed historical global trends in temperature and their attribution to anthropogenic forcing, as well as with observed changes under the recent global warming of 0.5C. That is, spatial patterns of temperature changes associated with the 0.5C difference in GMST warming between 19912010 and 19601979 are consistent with projected changes under 1.5C and 2C of global warming. The largest increase in annual mean temperature is found in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere across all levels of global warming. This phenomenon peaks in the Arctic and is known as Arctic amplification, with the underlying physical mechanisms assessed in detail in Section 4.5.1 and Chapter 7, Section 7.4.4.1. For the CMIP6 ensemble average considered here, Arctic annual mean temperatures warm by a factor of 2.3, 2.5, 2.4 and 2.4 for 1.5C, 2C, 3C and 4C of global warming, respectively. That is, Arctic warming scales approximately linearly with GSAT. Generally, when Arctic amplification is considered across individual models, warming occurs at a factor of 24 times the global level of warming. It is unlikely that warming in the SH high latitudes in the 21st century will exceed the change in GSAT, or that it will substantially exceed warming in the tropics, for GSAT change ranging between 1.5C and 4C. Correspondingly, there is low confidence of Antarctic amplification occurring under transient, 21st century low mitigation scenarios. The Antarctic continent is projected to warm at a higher rate than the mid-latitude Southern Ocean, however, at all levels of global warming. The relevant physical mechanisms that reduce the amplitude of polar amplification over Antarctica compared to the Arctic are assessed in detail in Section"}

The transient response of the mid-latitude jets to forcing in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere behaves nonlinearly with GSAT. This is a consequence of the time-dependence of the relationship between radiative forcing and GSAT and the temporal evolution of SST patterns, with a potential seasonal component in the SH associated with polar stratospheric temperature changes. Consequently, the epoch approach applied to a transient simulation of the 21st century will overestimate the mid-latitude circulation response in a stabilized climate. Dedicated time slice experiments simulating stabilized climates are therefore required to assess differences in mid-latitude circulation at given levels of global warming. A further complication in the SH is the competing influences of ozone recovery and increasing GHG concentrations on the austral-summer mid-latitude circulation during the first half the 21st century. Using transient 21st century experiments to diagnose changes in SH mid-latitude circulation at different levels of warming therefore confounds the effects of ozone recovery and GHG increases. Given these various limitations, we do not apply epoch analysis to assess mid-latitude atmospheric circulation changes and related annular modes of variability. 4.6.2 Climate Goals, Overshoot, and Path-Dependence Many scenarios aiming at limiting warming by 2100 to 1.5C involve overshoot  ERF temporarily exceeds a certain level before peaking and declining again. To quantify the implications of any such overshoot, this subsection assesses reversibility of climate due to temporary overshoot of GSAT levels during the 21st century, and implications for the use of carbon budgets. It also assesses differences in climate outcomes under different pathways, with a focus on comparing the SSPs used in CMIP6 with the RCPs used in CMIP5. 4.6.2.1 Climate change under overshoot The SR1.5 concluded with high confidence that overshoot trajectories result in higher impacts and associated challenges compared to pathways that limit global warming to 1.5C with no or limited overshoot. The degree and duration of overshoot affects the risks and impacts likely to be experienced and the emissions pathway required to achieve it. Consequences such as on ice sheets and climatic extremes have been found to be greater at 2C of global warming than at 1.5C but even on recovery to lower temperatures, these effects may not reverse. Overshoot has been found to lead to irreversible changes in thermosteric sea-level, AMOC, ice-sheets, and permafrost carbon and to long-lasting effects on ocean heat. Abrupt changes and tipping points are not well understood, but the higher the warming level and the longer the duration of overshoot, the greater the risk of unexpected changes. Non-reversal of the hydrological cycle has also been found in some studies with an increase in global precipitation following CO2 decrease being attributed to a build-up of ocean heat, and to a fast atmospheric adjustment to CO2 radiative forcing. Global temperature is expected to remain approximately constant if emissions of CO2 were to cease (Section"}

We assess here results from an overshoot scenario, which explores the implications of a peak and decline in forcing during the 21st century. Reversibility under more extreme and idealised carbon dioxide removal scenarios is assessed in Section 4.6.3. In SSP5-3.4-OS, CO2 peaks at 571 ppm in the year 2062 and reverts to 497 ppm by 2100  approximately the same level as in 2040. SSP5-3.4-OS has strong net negative emissions of CO2, exceeding those in SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9 from 2070 onwards and reaching 5.5 PgC yr-1 by 2100. While this causes global mean temperature to decline, changes in climate have not fully reversed by 2100 under this reversal of CO2 concentration. Quantities are compared for 20812100 relative to a 20-year period of the same average CO2. Differences between these two periods of the same CO2 are: GSAT: 0.280.30C; global land precipitation: 0.0260.011 mm/day; September Arctic sea-ice area: 0.320.53 million km2; thermosteric sea-level: 120.8 cm. As assessed in Section 9.3.1.1, Arctic sea-ice area is linearly reversible with GSAT. Although these climate quantities are not fully reversible, the overshoot scenario results in reduced climate change compared with stabilisation or continued increase in greenhouse gases.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. The transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions, TCRE, allows climate policy goals to be associated with remaining carbon budgets as global temperature increase is near-linear with cumulative emissions. Research since AR5 has shown that the concept of near-linearity of climate change to cumulative carbon emissions holds for measures other than just GSAT, such as regional climate or extremes(Seneviratne et al., 2016). However, ocean heat and carbon uptake do exhibit path dependence, leading to deviation from the TCRE relationship for levels of overshoot above 300 PgC. Sea-level rise, loss of ice-sheets, and permafrost carbon release may not reverse under overshoot and recovery of GSAT and cumulative emissions. TCRE remains a valuable concept to assess climate policy goals and how to achieve them but given the non-reversibility of different climate metrics with CO2 and GSAT reductions, it has limitations associated with evaluating the climate response under overshoot scenarios and CO2 removal. 4.6.2.2 Consistency between Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration"}

Emergence happens later at the regional scale, with a median time of emergence of 3045 years after emission paths separate in RCP2.6 relative to RCP4.5 and RCP8.5; a stricter requirement of 95% confidence level instead of median induces a delay of several decades, bringing time of emergence toward the end of the 21st century at regional scales. Attribution to emissions reductions, for the case of RCP2.6 relative to RCP4.5, is not substantially more likely for 20212035 trends in upper-2000m OHC than for GSAT, although OHC change is thought to be less susceptible to internal variability. Furthermore, found only around 10% likelihood of mitigation-benefit emergence during 20212035 for change in AMOC and September Arctic sea-ice area. showed that the differences in temperature extremes between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 over all land areas become statistically significant by 2050. The seemingly contrasting result of that mitigation benefits arise earlier for climate extremes poses no contradiction, because did not look at emergence as defined here but at the extremes of a distribution, which differ between scenarios already at a time when the distributions are still largely overlapping. In summary, if strong mitigation is applied from 2020 onward as reflected in SSP1-1.9, its effect on 20-year trends in GSAT would likely emerge during the near term, measured against an assumed non-mitigation scenario such as SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. However, the response of many other climate quantities to mitigation would be largely masked by internal variability during the near term, especially on the regional scale. The mitigation benefits for these quantities would emerge only later during the 21st century. During the near term, a small fraction of the surface can show cooling under all scenarios assessed here, so near-term cooling at any given location is fully consistent with globally averaged surface warming. 4.6.3.2 Climate Response to Mitigation by Carbon Dioxide Removal CDR options include afforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, wet land restoration, ocean fertilization, ocean alkalinisation, enhanced terrestrial weathering and direct air capture and storage. Chapter 8 assesses the implications of CDR for water cycle changes. The potential of different CDR options in terms of the amount of CO2 removed per year from the atmosphere, costs, cobenefits and side effects of the CDR approaches are assessed in the SR1.5, the AR6 WGIII report, and in several review papers. In the literature, CDR options are also referred to as negative CO2 emission technologies. Deployment of CDR will lead to a reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels only if uptake by sinks exceeds net CO2 emissions. Hence, there could be a substantial delay between the initiation of CDR and net CO2 emissions turning negative, and the time to reach net negative CO2 emissions and the evolution of atmospheric CO2 and climate thereafter would depend on the combined pathways of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, CDR, and natural sinks. The cooling due to CDR would be proportional to the cumulative amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere by CDR, as implied by the near-linear relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and GSAT change Emission pathways that limit globally averaged warming to 1.5C or 2C by the year 2100 assume the use of CDR approaches in combination with emission reductions to follow net negative CO2 emissions trajectory in the second half of this century. For instance, in SR1.5, all analysed pathways limiting warming to 1.5C by 2100 with no or limited overshoot include the use of CDR to some extent to offset anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the median of CO2 removal across all scenarios was 730 GtCO2 in the 21st century. Affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable CDR options at scale well before 2050 are an important element of 1.5C-consistent pathways especially in overshoot"}

Earlier modelling studies focused on the effect of equatorial sulphate injection that tends to overcool the tropics and undercool the poles. Compared to equatorial injection, off-equatorial injection at multiple locations shows a closer resemblance to the baseline climate in many aspects, including temperature, precipitation, and sea ice coverage. However, significant regional and seasonal residual and overcompensating climate change is reported, including regional shifts in precipitation, continued warming of polar oceans, and shifts in the seasonal cycle of snow depth and sea ice cover(Fasullo et al., 2018)(Jiang et al., 2019). By appropriately adjusting the amount, latitude, altitude, and timing of the aerosol injection, modelling studies suggest that SAI is conceptually able to achieve some desired combination of radiative forcing and climate response(MacMartin et al., 2017)(Visioni et al., 2020b)(Lee et al., 2020). There is large uncertainty in the stratospheric response to SAI, and the change in stratospheric dynamics and chemistry would depend on the amount, size, type, location, and timing of injection. There is high confidence that aerosol-induced stratospheric heating will play an important role in surface climate change by altering the effective radiative forcing, lower stratosphere stability, quasi-biennial oscillation(Kleinschmitt et al., 2018a), polar vortexes, and North Atlantic Oscillation. Model simulations indicate stronger polar jets and weaker storm tracks and a poleward shift of the tropospheric mid-latitude jets in response to stratospheric sulphate injections in the tropics(Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018), as the meridional temperature gradient is increased in the lower stratosphere by the aerosol-induced heating. The aerosol-induced warming would also offset some of the GHG-induced stratospheric cooling. Compared to equatorial injection, offequatorial injection is likely to result in reduced change in stratospheric heating, circulation, and QBO(Kravitz et al., 2019). Stratospheric ozone response to sulphate injection is uncertain depending on the amount, altitude, and location of injection. It is likely that sulphate injection would cause a reduction in polar column ozone concentration and delay the recovery of Antarctic ozone hole(Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018)(Tilmes et al., 2018b), which would have implications for UV radiation and surface ozone(Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018)(Tilmes et al., 2018b)(Xia et al., 2017). Injection of non-sulphate aerosols is likely to result in less stratospheric heating and ozone loss(Weisenstein et al., 2015)(Pope et al., 2012). One side effect of SAI is increased sulphate deposition at surface. A recent modelling study indicates that to maintain global temperature at 2020 levels under RCP 8.5, increased sulphate deposition from stratospheric sulphate injection could be globally balanced by the projected decrease in tropospheric anthropogenic SO2 emission, but the spatial distribution of sulphate deposition would move from low to high latitudes. Marine cloud brightening MCB involves injecting small aerosols such as sea salt into the base of marine stratocumulus clouds where the aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei. In the absence of other changes, an increase in CCN would produce higher cloud droplet number concentration with reduced droplet sizes, increasing cloud albedo. Increased droplet concentration may also increase cloud water content and optical thickness, but recent studies suggest that liquid water path response to anthropogenic aerosols is weak due to the competing effects of suppressed precipitation and enhanced cloud water evaporation. An analogue for MCB are reflective, persistent ship tracks observed after the passage of a sea-going vessel emitting combustion aerosols into susceptible clouds. A recent study found a substantial increase in cloud reflectivity from shipping in southeast Atlantic basin, suggesting that a regional-scale test of MCB in stratocumulusdominated regions could be successful. Modelling studies suggest that MCB has the potential to achieve a negative forcing of about 1 to 5 W m-2, depending on the deployment area and strategies of cloud seeding(Alterskjr et al., 2013). Regional applications of MCB has also been suggested for offsetting severe impacts from tropical cyclones whose genesis is associated with"}

However, such regional approaches also involve large uncertainties in the magnitude of the responses and consequences. Several modelling studies suggest that the direct scattering effect by injected particles might also play an important role in the cooling effect of MCB, but the relative contribution of aerosolcloud and aerosol6 cloudradiation effect is uncertain. Relative to the high-GHG climate, it is likely that MCB would increase precipitation over tropical land due to the inhomogeneous forcing pattern of MCB over ocean and land(Stjern et al., 2018). Because of the high level of uncertainty associated with cloud microphysics and aerosolcloudradiation interaction, the climate response to MCB is as uncertain. Results from global climate models are subject to large uncertainty because of different treatment of cloud microphysics and inadequate representation of sub-grid aerosol and cloud processes. Sea salt deposition over land and the effect of sea salt emission on atmospheric chemistry are some of the potential side effects of MCB. Cirrus Cloud Thinning Cirrus clouds trap more outgoing thermal radiation than they reflect incoming solar radiation and thus have an overall warming effect on the climate system. The aim of CCT is to reduce cirrus cloud optical depth by increasing the heterogeneous nucleation via seeding cirrus clouds with an optimal concentration of ice nucleating particles,which might cause larger ice crystals and rapid fallout, resulting in reduced lifetime and coverage of cirrus clouds,. CCT aims to achieve the opposite effect of contrails that increase cirrus cover and cause a small positive ERF. A high-resolution modelling study of CCT over a limited area of the Arctic suggested that cirrus seeding causes a decrease in ice crystal number concentration and a reduction in mixed-phase cloud cover, both of which cause a cooling effect. Under present-day climate, cirrus clouds exerts a net positive radiative forcing of about 5 W m-2(Hong et al., 2016), indicating a maximum cooling potential of the same magnitude if all cirrus cloud were removed from the climate system. However, modelling results show a much smaller cooling effect of CCT. For the optimal ice nuclei seeding concentration and globally non-uniform seeding strategy, a net negative cloud radiative forcing of about 1 to 2 W m-2 is achieved. A few studies find that no seeding strategy could achieve a significant cooling effect, owing to complex microphysical mechanisms limiting robust climate responses to cirrus seeding. A higher than optimal concentration of ice nucleating particles could also result in over-seeding that increases rather than decreases cirrus optical thickness. Thus, there is low confidence in the cooling effect of CCT, due to limited understanding of cirrus microphysics, its interaction with aerosols, and the complexity of seeding strategy. Relative to the high-GHG climate and for the same amount of global cooling, CCT is simulated to cause an increase in global precipitation compared to shortwave-based SRM options such as SAI and MCB because of the opposing effects of CCT and increased CO2 on outgoing longwave radiation. Combining SAI and CCT has suggested that GHG-induced changes in global mean temperature and precipitation can be simultaneously offset, but there is low confidence in the applicability of this result to the real world owing to the large uncertainty in simulating aerosol forcing and the complex cirrus microphysical processes. Surface-based albedo modification Surface-based albedo modification could, in principle, achieve a negative radiative forcing of a few W m-2 by enhancing the albedo of the ocean surface(Gabriel et al., 2017). However, the technology does not exist today to increase ocean albedo at large scale. An increase in crop albedo or roof"}

Assessment of remaining carbon budgets requires an assessment of zero CO2 emissions commitment as well as of the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions. There is an offset of continued warming following cessation of emissions by continued CO2 removal by natural sinks. Some models continue warming by up to 0.5C after emissions cease at 2C of warming, while others simulate little to no additional warming. In SR1.5, the available evidence indicated that past CO2 emissions do not commit to substantial further warming. A ZEC close to zero was thus applied for the computation of the remaining carbon budget for the. However, the available literature consisted of simulations from a small number of models using a variety of experimental designs, with some simulations showing a complex evolution of temperature following cessation of emissions. Here we draw on new simulations to provide an assessment of ZEC using multiple ESMs and EMICs. Figure 4.39 shows results from 20 models that simulate the evolution of CO2 and the GSAT response following cessation of CO2 emissions for an experiment where 1000 PgC is emitted during a 1% per year CO2 increase. All simulations show a strong reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentration following cessation of CO2 emissions in agreement with previous studies and basic theory that natural carbon sinks will persist. Therefore, there is very high confidence that atmospheric CO2 concentrations would decline for decades if CO2 emissions cease. Temperature evolution in the 100 years following cessation of emissions varies by model and across timescales, with some models showing declining temperature, others having ZEC close to zero, and others showing continued warming following cessation of emissions. The GSAT response depends on the balance of carbon sinks and ocean heat uptake. The 20-year average GSAT change 50 years after the cessation of emissions is summarised in Table 4.8. The mean value of ZEC50 is 0.079C, with 595% range 27 0.34 to 0.28 C. There is no strong relationship between ZEC50 and modelled climate sensitivity. It is therefore likely that the absolute magnitude of ZEC50 is less than 0.3 C, but we assess low confidence in the sign of ZEC on 50-year timescales. This is small compared with natural variability in GSAT. Figure 4.39: Zero Emissions Commitment.

The accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere is determined by the balance between anthropogenic emissions, anthropogenic removals, and physical-biogeochemical source and sink dynamics on land and in the ocean. This chapter assesses how physical and biogeochemical processes of the carbon and nitrogen cycles affect the variability and trends of GHGs in the atmosphere as well as ocean acidification and deoxygenation. It identifies physical and biogeochemical feedbacks that have affected or could affect future rates of GHG accumulation in the atmosphere, and therefore, influence climate change and its impacts. This chapter also assesses the remaining carbon budget to limit global warming within various goals, as well as the large-scale consequences of carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation modification on biogeochemical cycles. The Human Perturbation of the Carbon and Biogeochemical cycles Global mean concentrations for well-mixed GHGs in 2019 correspond to increases of about 47%, 156%, and 23%, respectively, above the levels in 1750. Current atmospheric concentrations of the three GHGs are higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years, and in 2019 reached 409.9 ppm of CO2, 1866.3 ppb of CH4, and 332.1 ppb of N2O. Current CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are also unprecedented in the last 2 million years. In the past 60 Myr, there have been periods in Earths history when CO2 concentrations were significantly higher than at present, but multiple lines of evidence show that the rate at which CO2 has increased in the atmosphere during 19002019 is at least 10 times faster than at any other time during the last 800,000 years, and 4-5 times faster than during the last 56 million years. Contemporary Trends of Greenhouse Gases It is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, CH4, and N2O in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities. This assessment is based on multiple lines of evidence including atmospheric gradients, isotopes, and inventory data. During the last measured decade, global average annual anthropogenic emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O, reached the highest levels in human history at 10.9  0.9 PgC yr-1, 335383 Tg CH4 yr-1, and 4.211.4 TgN yr-1, respectively.. The CO2 emitted from human activities during the decade of 20102019 was distributed between three Earth system components: 46% accumulated in the atmosphere, 23% was taken up by the ocean and 31% was stored by vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems. Of the total anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the combustion of fossil fuels was responsible for 8191%, with the remainder being the net CO2 flux from land-use change and land management. Over the past six decades, the average fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions that has accumulated in the atmosphere has remained nearly constant at approximately 44%. The ocean and land sinks of CO2 have continued to grow over the past six decades in response to increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Interannual and decadal variability of the regional and global ocean and land sinks indicate that these sinks are sensitive to climate conditions and therefore to climate change. Recent observations show that ocean carbon processes are starting to change in response to the growing ocean sink, and these changes are expected to contribute significantly to future weakening of the ocean sink under mediumto high-emission scenarios. However, the effects of these changes is not"}

Climate change alone is expected to increase land carbon accumulation in the high latitudes, but also to lead to a counteracting loss of land carbon in the tropics. More than half of the latest CMIP6 ESMs include nutrient limitations on the carbon cycle, but these models still project increasing tropical land carbon and increasing global land carbon through the 21st century. Future trajectories of the ocean CO2 sink are strongly emissions-scenario dependent. Emission scenarios SSP4-6.0 and SSP5-8.5 lead to warming of the surface ocean and large reductions of the buffering capacity, which will slow the growth of the ocean sink after 2050. Scenario SSP1-2.6 limits further reductions in buffering capacity and warming, and the ocean sink weakens in response to the declining rate of increasing atmospheric CO2. There is low confidence in how changes in the biological pump will influence the magnitude and direction of the ocean carbon feedback. Beyond 2100, land and ocean may transition from being a carbon sink to a source under either very high emissions or net negative emissions scenarios, but for different reasons. Under very high emissions scenarios such as SSP5-8.5, ecosystem carbon losses due to warming lead the land to transition from a carbon sink to a source, while the ocean is expected to remain a sink. For scenarios in which CO2 concentration stabilizes, land and ocean carbon sinks gradually take up less carbon as the increase in atmospheric CO2 slows down. In scenarios with moderate net negative CO2 emissions and CO2 concentrations declining during the 21st century, the land sink transitions to a net source in decades to a few centuries after CO2 emissions become net negative, while the ocean remains a sink. Under scenarios with large net negative CO2 emissions and rapidly declining CO2 concentrations (e.g., SSP5-3.4-OS), both land and ocean switch from a sink to a transient source during the overshoot period. Thawing terrestrial permafrost will lead to carbon release, but there is low confidence in the timing, magnitude and the relative roles of CO2 versus CH4 as feedback processes. CO2 release from permafrost is projected to be 341 PgC per 1oC of global warming by 2100, based on an ensemble of models. However, the incomplete representation of important processes such as abrupt thaw, combined with weak observational constraints, only allow low confidence in both the magnitude of these estimates and in how linearly proportional this feedback is to the amount of global warming. It is very unlikely that gas clathrates in terrestrial and subsea permafrost will lead to a detectable departure from the emissions trajectory during this century. The net response of natural CH4 and N2O sources to future warming will be increased emissions. Key processes include increased CH4 emissions from wetlands and permafrost thaw, as well as increased soil N2O emissions in a warmer climate, while ocean N2O emissions are projected to decline at centennial time scale. The magnitude of the responses of each individual process and how linearly proportional these feedbacks are to the amount of global warming is known with low confidence due to incomplete representation of important processes in models combined with weak observational constraints. Models project that over the 21st century the combined feedback of 0.020.09 W m-2 C-1 is comparable to the effect of a CO2 release of 5-18 PgCeq C-1. The response of biogeochemical cycles to the anthropogenic perturbation can be abrupt at regional scales, and irreversible on decadal to century time scales. The probability of crossing uncertain regional thresholds increases with climate change. Possible abrupt changes and tipping points in biogeochemical cycles lead to additional uncertainty in 21st century GHG concentrations, but these are very likely to be smaller than the uncertainty associated with future anthropogenic emissions.

Halting global warming would thus require global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions to become zero. The ratio between cumulative CO2 emissions and the consequent GSAT increase, which is called the transient climate response to cumulative emissions of CO2, likely falls in the 1.0C2.3C per 1000 PgC range. The narrowing of this range compared to AR5 is due to a better integration of evidence across the science in this assessment. Beyond this century, there is low confidence that the TCRE remains an accurate predictor of temperature changes in scenarios of very low or net negative CO2 emissions because of uncertain Earth system feedbacks that can result in further warming or a path-dependency of warming as a function of cumulative CO2 emissions. Mitigation requirements over this century for limiting maximum warming to specific levels can be quantified using a carbon budget that relates cumulative CO2 emissions to global mean temperature increase. For the period 18502019, a total of 655  65 PgC of anthropogenic CO2 has been emitted. Remaining carbon budgets for limiting warming to 1.5C, 1.7C, and 2.0C are 140 PgC, 230 PgC and 370 PgC, respectively, based on the 50th percentile of TCRE. For the 67th percentile, the respective values are 110 PgC, 190 PgC and 310 PgC. These remaining carbon budgets may vary by an estimated  60 PgC depending on how successfully future non-CO2 emissions can be reduced. Since AR5 and SR1.5, estimates have undergone methodological improvements, resulting in larger, yet consistent estimates. Several factors affect the precise value of remaining carbon budgets, including estimates of historical warming, future emissions from thawing permafrost, and variations in projected non-CO2 warming. Remaining carbon budget estimates can increase or decrease by 150 PgC due to uncertainties in the level of historical warming, and by an additional  60 PgC due to geophysical uncertainties surrounding the climate response to non-CO2 emissions such as CH4, N2O, and aerosols. Permafrost thaw is included in the estimates together with other feedbacks that are often not captured by models. Despite the large uncertainties surrounding the quantification of the effects of additional Earth system feedback processes, such as emissions from wetlands and permafrost thaw, these feedbacks represent identified additional amplifying risk factors that scale with additional warming and mostly increase the challenge of limiting warming to specific temperature thresholds. These uncertainties do not change the basic conclusion that global CO2 emissions would need to decline to at least net zero to halt global warming. Biogeochemical Implications of Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar Radiation Modification Landand ocean-based carbon dioxide removal methods have the potential to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, but the benefits of this removal would be partially offset by CO2 release from land and ocean carbon stores. The fraction of CO2 removed that remains out of the atmosphere, a measure of CDR effectiveness, decreases slightly with increasing amount of removal and decreases strongly if CDR is applied at lower CO2 concentrations. The century-scale climatecarbon cycle response to a CO2 removal from the atmosphere is not always equal and opposite to the response to a CO2 emission. For simultaneously cumulative CO2 emissions and removals of greater than or equal to 100 PgC, CO2 emissions are 4  3% more effective at raising atmospheric CO2 than CO2 removals are at lowering atmospheric CO2. The asymmetry originates from state-dependencies and non-linearities in carbon cycle processes and implies that an extra amount of CDR is required to compensate for a positive emission of a given magnitude to attain the same change in atmospheric CO2. The net effect of this asymmetry on the global surface temperature is poorly constrained due to low agreement between models. Wide-ranging side-effects of CDR methods have been identified that can either weaken or strengthen the carbon sequestration and cooling potential of these methods and affect the achievement of"}

The section shows the progress made since the AR5 and the 1.5C Special Report, particularly on key components required to estimate the remaining carbon budget, including the transient response to cumulative emissions of CO2, the zero emission commitment, the projected non-CO2 warming, and the unrepresented Earth system feedbacks. Section 5.6 assesses the impacts of carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation modification for the purpose of climate mitigation on the global carbon cycle building from the assessment in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land.

Figure 5.1: Visual abstract for Chapter 5. 5.1.1 The Physical and Biogeochemical Processes in Carbon-Climate feedbacks The influence of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and emission scenarios on the carbon  climate system is primarily driving the ocean and terrestrial sinks as major negative feedbacks that determine the atmospheric CO2 levels, that then drive climate feedbacks through radiative forcing. Biogeochemical feedbacks follow as an outcome of both carbon and climate forcing on the physics and the biogeochemical processes of the ocean and terrestrial carbon cycles. Together, these carbon-climate feedbacks can amplify or suppress climate change by altering the rate at which CO2 builds up in the atmosphere through changes in the land and ocean sources and sinks. These changes depend on the, often non-linear, interaction of the drivers and processes in the ocean and land as well as the emission scenarios. There is high confidence that carbon-climate feedbacks and their century scale evolution play a critical role in two linked climate metrics that have significant climate and policy implications: the fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions that remains in the atmosphere, the so-called airborne fraction of CO2, and the quasi-linear trend characteristic of the transient temperature response to cumulative CO2 emissions and other GHGs. This chapter assesses the implications of these issues from a carbon cycle processes perspective in Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6. The airborne fraction is an important constraint for adjustments in carbon-climate feedbacks and reflects the partitioning of CO2 emissions between reservoirs by the negative feedbacks, which for the decade 201053 2019 were 31% on land and 23% in the ocean and also dominated the historical period.

The negative feedback to CO2 concentrations is associated with its impact on the air-sea and air-land CO2 exchange through strengthening of partial pressure of CO2 gradients as well as the internal processes that enhance uptake. Two of these key processes are the buffering capacity of the ocean and the CO2 fertilisation effect on gross primary production. Positive and negative climate and carbon feedbacks involve, fast processes on land and oceans at time scales from minutes to years such as photosynthesis, soil respiration, net primary production, shallow ocean physics and air-sea fluxes, and slower processes taking decades to millennia such as changing ocean buffering capacity, ocean ventilation, vegetation dynamics, permafrost changes, peat formation and decomposition. Depending on the particular combination of driver process and response dynamics, they behave as positive or negative feedbacks that amplify or dampen the magnitude and rates of climate change, respectively; red and turquoise arrows in Figure 5.2; Section 5.2.1.5; Table 5.1). Carbon cycle feedbacks co-exist with climate feedbacks, which together drive contemporary and future carbon-climate feedbacks. The excess heat generated by radiative forcing from increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 and other GHGs is mostly taken up by the ocean and the residual balance partitioned between atmospheric, terrestrial and ice melting. The combined effect of these two large scale negative feedbacks of CO2 and heat are reflected in the TCRE, which points to a quasi-linear and quasi-emission-path independent relationship between cumulative emissions of CO2 and global warming, which is used as the basis to estimate the remaining carbon budget. There is still low confidence on the relative roles and importance of the ocean and terrestrial carbon processes on TCRE variability and uncertainty on centennial time scales. Figure 5.2: Key compartments, processes and pathways that govern historical and future CO2 concentrations and carbonclimate feedbacks through the coupled earth system. The anthropogenic CO2 emissions, including land use change, are partitioned via negative feedbacks between the ocean, the land and the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 that sets the changing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. This regulates most of the radiative forcing that creates the heat imbalance that drives the climate feedbacks to the ocean and land. Positive feedbacks result from processes in the ocean and on land. Positive feedbacks are influenced by both carbon-concentration and carbon-climate feedbacks simultaneously. Additional biosphere processes have been included but these have an as yet uncertain feedback impact. CO2 removal from the atmosphere into the ocean, land and geological reservoirs, necessary for negative emissions, has been included. Although this schematic is built around CO2, the dominant GHG, some of the same processes also influence the fluxes of CH4 and N2O and the strength of the positive feedbacks from the terrestrial and ocean systems. The combined effects of climate and CO2 concentration feedbacks on the global carbon cycle are projected by ESMs to modify both the processes and natural reservoirs of carbon on a regional and global scale that may result in positive feedbacks, which could weaken the major terrestrial and ocean sinks and disrupt both the airborne fraction and TCRE under medium to high emission scenarios."}

Land-use-related component fluxes can be verified by the growing databases of global satellite-based biomass observations in combination with information on remotely-sensed land cover change, but differ from bookkeeping and modelling with Dynamic Global Vegetation Models in excluding legacy emissions from pre-satellite-era land use change and land management, and neglecting soil carbon changes, and often focus on gross deforestation, not regrowth. For the decade 20102019, average emissions were estimated at 1.6  0.7 PgC yr-1. A likely general upward trend since 1850 is reversed during the second part of the 20th century. Trends since the 1980s have low confidence because they differ between estimates, which is related inter alia to Houghton and Nassikas using a different land use forcing than Hansis et al. and the DGVMs. Higher emissions estimates are expected from DGVMs run under transient environmental conditions compared to bookkeeping estimates, because the DGVM estimate includes the loss of additional sink capacity. Because the transient setup requires a reference simulation without land use change to separate anthropogenic fluxes from natural land fluxes, LULUCF estimates by DGVMs include the sink forests would have developed in response to environmental changes on areas that in reality have been cleared. The agricultural areas that replaced these forests have a reduced residence time of carbon, lacking woody material, and thus provide a substantially smaller additional sink over time. The loss of additional sink capacity is growing in particular with atmospheric CO2 and increases DGVM-based LULUCF flux estimates relative to bookkeeping estimates over time. Gross emissions are on average 23 times larger than the net flux from LULUCF, increasing from an average of 3.5  1.2 PgC yr1 for the decade of the 1960s to an average of 4.4  1.6 PgC yr1 during 201027 2019. Gross removals partly balance these gross emissions to yield as the sum the net flux from LULUCF and increase from 2.0  0.7 PgC yr1 for the 1960s to 2.9  1.2 PgC yr1 during 2010-2019. These large gross fluxes show the relevance of land management such as harvesting or rotational agriculture and the large potential to reduce emissions by halting deforestation and degradation. More evidence on the pre-industrial LULUCF flux has emerged since AR5 in the form of new estimates of cumulative carbon losses until today and of a better understanding of natural carbon cycle processes over the Holocene. Cumulative carbon losses by land use activities since the start of agriculture and forestry have been estimated at 116 PgC based on global compilations of carbon stocks for soils with about 70 PgC of this occurring prior to 1750, and for vegetation as 447 PgC. Emissions prior to 1750 can be estimated by subtracting the post-1750 LULUCF flux from Table 5.1 from the combined soil and vegetation losses until today; they would then amount to 328 PgC assuming error ranges are independent. A share of 353 PgC from prior to 1800 has indirectly been suggested as the difference between net biosphere flux and terrestrial sink estimates, which is compatible with ice-core records due to a low airborne fraction of anthropogenic emissions in pre-industrial times. Low confidence is assigned to pre-industrial emissions estimates. Since AR5, evidence emerged that the LULUCF flux might have been underestimated as DGVMs include anthropogenic land cover change, but often ignore land management practices not associated with a change in land cover; land management is more widely captured by bookkeeping models through use of observation-based carbon densities. Sensitivity studies show that practices such as wood and crop harvesting increase global net LULUCF emissions and explain about half of the cumulative loss in biomass. 5.2.1.2 Atmosphere"}

Since then, measurements have been extended to multiple locations around the world. In addition, high density global observations of total column CO2 measurements have been made since 2009 by dedicated greenhouse gases observing satellites. Annual mean CO2 growth rates are observed to be 1.56  0.18 ppm yr-1 over the 61 years of atmospheric measurements, with the rate of CO2 accumulation almost tripling from an average of 0.82  0.29 ppm yr-1 during the decade of 19601969 to 2.39  0.37 ppm yr-1 during the decade of 20102019. The latter agrees well with that derived for total column measurements by the greenhouse gases observing satellite. The interannual oscillations in monthly-mean CO2 growth rates show close relationship with the El Nino southern oscillation cycle due to the ENSO-driven changes in terrestrial and ocean CO2 sources and sinks on the Earths surface. Multiple lines of evidence unequivocally establish the dominant role of human activities in the growth of atmospheric CO2. First, the systematic increase in the difference between the MLO and SPO records is caused primarily by the increase in emissions from fossil fuel combustion in industrialised regions that are situated predominantly in the northern hemisphere. Second, measurements of the stable carbon isotope in the atmosphere are more negative over time because CO2 from fossil fuels extracted from geological storage is depleted in 13C. Third, measurements of the ratio show a declining trend because for every molecule of carbon burned, 1.17 to 1.98 molecules of oxygen is consumed. These three lines of evidence confirm unambiguously that the atmospheric increase of CO2 is due to an oxidative process. Fourth, measurements of radiocarbon at sites around the world show a continued long-term decrease in the 14C/12C ratio. Fossil fuels are devoid of 14C and therefore fossil-fuelderived CO2 additions decrease the atmospheric 14C/12C ratio.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. Over the past six decades, the fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions that has accumulated in the atmosphere has remained near constant at approximately 44%.

The sink rate has declined over the past six decades, which indicates that the combined ocean and land sinks are not growing as fast as the growth in atmospheric CO2. Possible explanations for the sink rate decline are that the land and/or ocean CO2 sinks are no longer responding linearly with CO2 concentrations or that anthropogenic emissions are slower than exponential.

Significant uncertainties remain on land CO2 sink partition of processes due to challenges in reconciling multiple-scale evidence from experiments to the globe, due to large spatial and inter-model differences in diagnosing dominant driving factors affecting the net land CO2 sink, and due to model deficiency in process representations. Nitrogen dynamics, a major gap in DGVMs identified in AR5, have now been incorporated in about half of the DGVMs contributing to the carbon budget of the Global Carbon Project (see Le Quere et al., for model characteristics) and a growing number of ESMs. However, as the representations of carbon-nitrogen interactions vary greatly among models, large uncertainties remain on how nitrogen cycling regulates the response of ecosystem carbon uptake to higher atmospheric CO2. Fire modules have been incorporated into 10 of 16 DGVMs contributing to the global carbon budget, and a growing number of models have representations of human ignitions and fire suppression processes. There are also growing DGVM developments to include management practices and the effects of secondary forest regrowth, though models still under represent intensively managed ecosystems, such as croplands and managed forests. Processes that have not yet played a significant role in the land CO2 sink of the past decades but can grow in importance, include permafrost and peatlands dynamics, have also been incorporated in some DGVMs. Growing numbers and varieties of Earth observations are being jointly used to drive and benchmark models, helping further identify key processes missing or mechanisms poorly represented in the current generation of DGVMs. Figure 5.10: Trends of the net land CO2 sink and related vegetation observations during 19802019.

A set of new satellite measurements applied to assess the variability of the tropical land carbon balance since AR5 confirm this statement, including satellite column CO2 measurements, estimating recent anomalous land-atmosphere CO2 exchange induced by El Nino at continental scale, and L-band vegetation optical depth, estimating tropical above-ground biomass carbon stock changes. In addition, based on medium evidence and medium agreement between studies with DGVMs and atmospheric inversions, semi-arid ecosystems over the tropical zones have a larger contribution to interannual variability in global land-atmosphere CO2 exchange than moist tropical forest ecosystems. Understanding the mechanisms driving interannual variability in the carbon cycle has the potential to provide insights into whether and to what extent the carbon cycle can affect the climate, with particular interests over the highly climate-sensitive tropical carbon cycle. Consistent findings from studies with atmospheric inversions, satellite observations and DGVMs lead to high confidence that the tropical net land CO2 sink is reduced under warmer and drier conditions, particularly during El Nino events. Interannual variations in tropical land-atmosphere CO2 exchange are significantly correlated with anomalies of tropical temperature, water availability and terrestrial water storage, whose relative contribution are difficult to separate due to covariations between these climatic factors. At continental scale, the dominant climatic driver of interannual variations of tropical landatmosphere CO2 exchange was temperature variations, which could partly result from the spatial compensation of the water availability effects on land-atmospheric CO2 exchange.

Seneviratne, Sergio M. Vicente-Serrano, Sonke Zaehle This box presents an assessment of interactions between the carbon and water cycles that influence the dynamics of the biosphere and its interaction with the climate system. It also highlights carbon-water tradeoffs arising from the use of land-based climate mitigation options. Individual aspects of the interactions between the carbon and water cycles are addressed in separate chapters. The influence of wetlands and dams on methane emissions is assessed elsewhere, as well as the consequences of permafrost thawing and/or increased flooding on wetland extent in the northern high latitudes and wet tropics. Does elevated CO2 alleviate the impacts of drought? Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration enhances leaf photosynthesis and drives a partial closure of leaf stomata, leading to higher water-use efficiency at the leaf, canopy to ecosystem scales. Since AR5, a growing body of evidence from tree-ring and carbon isotopes further confirms an increase of plant water-use efficiency over decadal to centennial time scales, with some evidence for a stronger enhancement of photosynthesis compared to stomatal reductions. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that WUE has increased in near proportionality to atmospheric CO2, at a rate generally consistent with Earth System Models, despite variation in the WUE response to CO2. Both field-scale CO2 enrichment experiments and process models show the effect of physiologically induced water savings, particularly under water limiting conditions. Plants can also benefit from reduced drought stress due to enhanced CO2 without ecosystems-scale water savings. This increased WUE offsets to some extent the effects of enhanced vapor pressure deficit on plant transpiration, but will have limited effect on ameliorating plant water stress during extreme drought events, when leaf stomata is governed primarily by soil moisture. Leaf stomata closure can have large effects on land freshwater availability because of reduced plant transpiration leading in some regions to higher soil moisture and runoff. However, increased water availability is often not realized because other CO2 physiological effects that enhance ecosystem evapotranspiration might offset the gains. These effects include plant growth and leaf area expansion, lengthening of the vegetative growing season, and the effects of stomatal closure on near-surface atmosphere that leads to increased air temperature and vapor-pressure deficits. ESMs show no consensus about the net hydrological response to physiological CO2 effects. Some studies show water savings as a consequence of the CO2 effects on leaf stomata closure, while other studies show that increased leaf area offsets the gains from increased WUE. However, these projections are subject to ESM uncertainties to quantify transpiration, among them the correct representations of plant hydraulic architecture such as changes in xylem anatomical properties and deep rooting."}

Increased CO2 concentrations alleviate the effects of water deficits on plant productivity but there is low confidence on its role under extreme drought conditions. There is low confidence that increased WUE by vegetation will substantially reduce global plant transpiration and diminish the frequency and severity of soil moisture and streamflow deficits associated with the radiative effect of higher CO2 concentrations. How does drought affect the terrestrial CO2 sink? Water availability controls the spatial distribution of photosynthesis over a larger part of the globe and, at local scale, drought decreases GPP more than respiration over most ecosystem types. This makes water availability a major climatic driver of variability in net ecosystem exchange. In addition to suppressing photosynthesis, field evidence suggests that droughts reduce the land CO2 sink also through increasing forest mortality and promoting wildfire. At the global scale, interannual variability in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate and global-scale terrestrial water storage from satellite shows that a lower global net land CO2 sink is associated with below-average terrestrial water storage. Atmospheric inversions based on surface and satellite column CO2 measurements show significant carbon release during drought events in pan-tropic areas. Regional extreme droughts in the mid-latitudes also lead to decreased GPP and land CO2 sink. Droughts cannot be compensated by equivalent wet anomalies because of the non-linear response of the terrestrial carbon uptake to soil moisture. Uncertainties remain on the magnitude of sensitivity of the land carbon fluxes to droughts. Global studies indicate stronger control of soil moisture to variations in satellite proxies of GPP than VPD. However, given that VPD increases exponentially with atmospheric warming, some studies suggest that the importance of VPD in stomatal regulation will become increasingly more important under warmer climate. It is difficult to isolate the relative contributions of warmer temperature, higher VPD and lower soil moisture. This is because land-atmosphere feedbacks cause a simultaneous increase of plant evaporative demand and of root zone water deficit impairing plant root uptake. These physiological responses can be further compounded by drought legacies, changes in structure and population dynamics due to forest mortality, disturbances associated with drought and possible trade-offs between resistance and resilience. Nonetheless, ESMs suggest that increased drought effects under very high levels of global warming contribute to the reduced efficiency of the land sink. In conclusion, there is high confidence that the global net land CO2 sink is reduced on interannual scale when regional-scale reductions in water availability associated with droughts occur, particularly in tropical regions. There is also high confidence that the global land sink will become less efficient due to soil moisture limitations and associated drought conditions in some regions for high emission scenarios, specially under global warming above 4C. However, there is low confidence on how these water cycle feedbacks will play out in lower emission scenarios due to uncertainties in regional rainfall changes and the balance between the CO2 fertilisation effect, through WUE, and the radiative impacts of greenhouse gases. What are the limits of carbon dioxide removal from a water cycle perspective? Carbon dioxide removal options based on terrestrial carbon sinks will require the appropriation of significant amounts of water at the landscape level. Most mitigation pathways that seek to limit global warming to 1.5C or less than 2C require the removal of about 30 to 300 GtC from the atmosphere by 2100. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and afforestation/reforestation are the dominant CDR options used in climate stabilisation scenarios implying large requirements for land and water (Section 5.6; (Beringer et al., 2011; Boysen et al., 2017b; Fajardy and Mac Dowell, 2017; Jans et"}

There is a budget imbalance of 0.1 PgCyr-1 which is within the uncertainties of the other terms. Over the industrial era, the total cumulative CO2 fossil fuel and industry emissions were 445  20 PgC, and the LULUCF flux was 240  70 PgC.

This budget does not explicitly account for source/sink dynamics due to carbon cycling in the landocean aquatic continuum comprising freshwaters, estuaries, and coastal areas. Natural and anthropogenic transfers of carbon from soils to freshwater systems are significant. Some of the carbon is buried in freshwater bodies, and a significant proportion returns to the atmosphere via outgassing from lakes, rivers and estuaries.

This effect is represented in all ESMs. New studies since AR5 add evidence that the leaf-level CO2 fertilisation is modulated by acclimation of photosynthesis to long-term CO2 exposure, growth temperature, seasonal drought, and nutrient availability, but these effects are not yet routinely represented in ESMs. Cross-Chapter Box 5.1 assesses multiple lines of evidence, which suggest that the ratio of plant CO2 uptake to water loss increases in near proportionality to atmospheric CO2. Despite advances in the regional coverage of field experiments, observations of the consequences of CO2 fertilisation at ecosystem level are still scarce, in particular from outside the temperate zone. New syntheses since AR5 corroborate that the effect of elevated CO2 on plant growth and ecosystem carbon storage is generally positive, but is modulated by temperature, water and nutrient availability. Plant carbon allocation, changes in plant community composition, disturbance, and natural plant mortality are important processes affecting the magnitude of the response, but are currently poorly represented in models, and thus contribute strongly to uncertainty in ESM projections. Field studies with elevated CO2 have demonstrated that the initial stimulation of above-ground growth may decline if insufficient nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorus are available. Model-data syntheses have demonstrated that the ability to capture the observed long-term effect of elevated CO2 depends on the ability of models to predict the effect of vegetation on soil biogeochemistry. Meta-analyses of CO2 manipulation experiments point to increased soil microbial activity and accelerated turnover of soil organic matter as a result of increased below-ground carbon allocation by plants, and increased root exudation or mycorrhizal activity due to enhanced plant nutrient requirements under elevated CO2. These effects are not considered in most ESMs. One global model that attempts to represent these processes suggests that elevated CO2 related carbon accumulation is reduced in soils but increased in vegetation relative to more conventional models. Our understanding of the effects of phosphorus limitation is less developed than for nitrogen, but a growing body of literature suggests it is as important, particularly in regions with highly weathered soils. CO2 experiments collectively show that soil phosphorus is an important constraint on the CO2 fertilisation effect on plant biomass. Indeed, a free-air CO2 enrichment experiment in a phosphorus-limited mature forest ecosystem did not find an increase in biomass production despite increases in photosynthesis after four years of CO2 exposure. The lack of free-air CO2 enrichment experiments in phosphorus-limited tropical forests limits our understanding on the role of phosphorus availability in constraining the CO2 fertilisation effect globally. Models accounting for the effects of phosphorus availability, in addition to nitrogen, generally show an even stronger reduction of the response of ecosystem carbon storage to elevated CO2. Insufficient data and uncertainties in the process formulation cause large uncertainty in the magnitude of this effect. Consistent with AR5, the CO2 fertilisation effect is the dominant cause for the projected increase in land carbon uptake between 1860 and 2100 in ESMs. In the CMIP6 ensemble, the increase of land carbon storage due to CO2 fertilisation is a global"}

The resulting increase of productivity is a key driver of increases in vegetation and soil carbon storage. However, consistent with earlier findings, processes affecting vegetation carbon-use efficiency and turnover such as allocation changes, mortality, and vegetation structural changes, as well as the pre-industrial soil carbon turnover time, also play an important role. As a major advance since AR5, 6 out of 11 models in the C4MIP-CMIP6 ensemble account for nitrogen cycle dynamics over land. On average, these models exhibit a 2530% lower CO2 fertilisation effect on land carbon storage, compared to models that do not. The only model in the C4MIP-CMIP6 ensemble that explicitly represents the effect of P availability on plant growth suggests the lowest C storage response to increasing CO2. The lower CO2 effect due to decreased nutrient availability is generally consistent with analyses of the implicit nutrient limitation in CMIP5 simulations and independent assessments by stand-alone land models. The simulated effects are generally consistent with expectations based on independent observations. However, the magnitude of nutrient feedbacks in these models is poorly constrained by observations, owing to the limited geographic distribution of available observations and the uncertain scaling of results obtained from manipulation experiments to transient system dynamics. Our understanding of the various biological processes, which affect the strength of the CO2 fertilisation effect on photosynthesis and its impact on carbon storage in vegetation and soils, in particular regarding the limitations imposed by nitrogen and phosphorus availability, has developed since AR5. Based on consistent behaviour across all CMIP6 ESMs, there is high confidence that CO2 fertilisation of photosynthesis acts as an important negative feedback on anthropogenic climate change, by reducing the rate at which CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere. Since AR5, an increasing number of CMIP6 ESMs account for nutrient cycles and the consistent results found in their model projections suggests with high confidence that limited nutrient availability will limit the CO2 fertilisation effect. The magnitude of both the direct CO2 effect on land carbon uptake, and its limitation by nutrients, remains uncertain. 5.4.2 Direct CO2 Effects on Projected Ocean Carbon Uptake In AR5 there was high agreement that CMIP5 ESMs project continued ocean CO2 uptake through to 2100, with higher uptake corresponding to higher concentration or emission pathways. There has been no significant change in the magnitude of the sensitivity of ocean carbon uptake to increasing atmospheric CO2, or in the inter-model spread, between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 era. The analysis from both emissions and concentration driven CMIP5 models projections show that the ocean sink stops growing beyond 2050 across all emission scenarios. CMIP6 models also show a similar time-evolution of global ocean CO2 uptake to CMIP5 models over the 21st century with decreasing net ocean CO2 uptake ratio to anthropogenic CO2 emissions under SSP58.5. The projected weakening of ocean carbon uptake is driven by a combination of decreasing carbonate buffering capacity and warming which are positive feedbacks under weak to no mitigation scenarios. In high mitigation scenarios, weakening ocean carbon uptake is driven by decreasing emissions. The detailed understanding of carbonate chemistry in seawater that has accumulated over more than half a century, provides high confidence that the excess CO2 dissolved in seawater leads to a nonlinear reduction of the CO2 buffering capacity, that is smaller dissolved inorganic carbon increase with respect to pCO2 increase along with the increase in cumulative ocean CO2 uptake. Recent studies suggest with medium confidence that the decrease in the ocean CO2 uptake ratio to anthropogenic CO2 emission under low to no mitigation scenarios over the 21st century is predominantly attributable to the ocean carbon-concentration feedback through the reduction of the seawater CO2 buffering capacity but with contributions from physical drivers such as warming and wind stress"}

Projections of increased fire weather in a warmer climate are widespread and may drive increased fire frequency and severity in several regions, including Arctic and boreal ecosystems, Mediterranean-type ecosystems, degraded tropical forests, and tropical forest-savanna transition zones. Wildfire is included in some CMIP6 ESMs and is thus only partially represented in estimates of carbon-climate feedbacks from these models. The CMIP5 ESMs that include fire project 858% increases of fire carbon emissions under future scenarios, with higher emissions under higher-warming scenarios; the ensemble spread is driven by differing factors such as population density, fire management, and other landuse processes. Fire dynamics in CMIP6 models, as evaluated in land-only configurations of CMIP6-generation land surface models, also show large variations but better agreement with observations. Climate change also drives changes to vegetation composition and ecosystem carbon storage through other disturbances such as forest dieback that lead to biome shifts in tropical forests, and temperate and boreal regions. AR5 assessed that large-scale loss of tropical forests due to climate change is unlikely. Newer ecosystem modelling approaches that include a greater degree of ecosystem heterogeneity and diversity show a reduced sensitivity of such forest dieback-type changes, supporting the AR5 assessment. Beyond such biome shifts, observations of tropical forests also show that increasing tree mortality rates within tropical forests may reduce carbon turnover times and storage, that increased tree mortality rates in tropical forests and elsewhere are expected with increased temperatures and vapor pressure deficit (Cross-chapter Box 5.1;, and that these processes are not well represented in ESMs. An ensemble of land models that include ecological processes such as forest demography shows that changes to mortality may be a more important driver of carbon dynamics than changes to productivity. Overall, climate change will force widespread increases in fire weather throughout the world. Because of incomplete inclusion of fire in ESMs, a separate compilation of fire-driven carbonclimate feedback estimates. There is low agreement in magnitude and medium agreement in sign, which alongside other literature, leads to an assessment of medium confidence that fire represents a positive carbon-climate feedback, but very low confidence in the magnitude of that feedback. Other disturbances such as tree mortality will increase across several ecosystems with decreased vegetation carbon. However, the lack of model agreement and lack of key process representation in ESMs lead to a low confidence assessment in the projected magnitude of this feedback. 5.4.3.3 Soil Carbon Changes to soil carbon stocks in response to climate change are a potentially strong positive feedback. Since the AR5, there has been progress made in understanding soil carbon dynamics, and associated feedbacks.

As in CMIP5, there is also a large CMIP6 ensemble spread in climate-driven soil carbon changes, partially driven by a large spread in the current soil carbon stocks predicted by the models. In CMIP5 ESMs, much of the soil carbon losses with warming can be traced to decreased carbon inputs, with a weaker contribution from changing soil carbon lifetimes due to faster decomposition rates, which may be an artefact of the lack of permafrost carbon. Isotopic constraints suggest that CMIP5 ESMs systematically overestimated the transient sensitivity of soil 14C responses to atmospheric 14C changes, implying that the models respond too quickly to changes in either inputs or turnover times and that the soil contribution to all feedbacks may thus be weaker than currently projected. Using natural gradients of soil carbon turnover as a constraint on long-term responses to warming suggests that both CMIP5 and CMIP6 ESMs may systematically underestimate the temperature sensitivity at high latitudes, and may overestimate the temperature sensitivity in the tropics, although experimental soil warming in tropical forests suggest high sensitivity of decomposition to warming in those regions as well. Peat soils, where thick organic layers build up due to saturated and anoxic conditions, represent another possible source of carbon to the atmosphere. Peats could dry, and decompose or burn as a result of climate change in both high and tropical latitudes, and in combination with anthropogenic drainage of peatlands. Peat carbon dynamics are not included in the majority of CMIP6 ESMs. Soil microbial dynamics shift in response to temperature, giving rise to complex longer-term trophic effects that are more complex than the short-term sensitivity of decomposition to temperature. Such responses are observed in response to long-term warming experiments. While most CMIP6 ESMs do not include microbial dynamics, simplified global soil models that do include such dynamics show greater uncertainty in projections of soil C changes, despite agreeing more closely with current observations, than the linear models used in most ESMs. In nutrient limited ecosystems, prolonged soil warming can induce a fertilisation effect through increased decomposition, which increases nutrient availability and thereby vegetation productivity. Models that include this process tend to show a weaker carbon-climate feedback than those that do not. In CMIP6, 6 out of 11 ESMs include a representation of the nitrogen cycle, and the mean of those models predicts a weaker carbon-climate feedback than the overall ensemble mean. These models only partly account for the interactions of nutrient effects with other processes such as shifts of vegetation zones under climate changes leading to either changes in species composition or changes in plant tissue nutrient to carbon ratios. The high agreement and multiple lines of evidence that warming increases decomposition rates lead to high confidence that warming will overall result in carbon losses relative to a constant climate and contribute to the positive carbon-climate feedback. However, the widespread in ESM projections and lack of model representation of key processes that may amplify or mitigate soil carbon losses on longer timescales lead to low confidence in the magnitude of global soil carbon losses with warming.

Of that carbon, permafrost soils and deposits store 10701360 PgC, of which 300400 PgC are in the first meter, and the rest at depth. The remaining 280340 Pg C are in permafrost-free soils within the permafrost region. These carbon deposits have accumulated over thousands of years due to the slow rates of organic matter decomposition in frozen and/or waterlogged soil layers, but these frozen soils are highly decomposable upon thaw. Is permafrost carbon already thawing and emitting greenhouse gases? The permafrost region was a historic carbon sink over centuries to millennia. Currently though, thawing soils due to anthropogenic warming are losing carbon from the decomposition of old frozen organic matter, as found via 14C signature of respiration at sites undergoing rapid permafrost thaw, of dissolved organic carbon in rivers draining watersheds with permafrost thaw, and of CH4 produced in thawing lakes. Despite accumulating evidence of increased carbon losses, it is difficult to scale up siteand ecosystem-level measurements to assess the net carbon balance over the entire permafrost region, due to the high spatial heterogeneity, the strong seasonal cycles and the difficulty in monitoring these regions consistently across the year. SROCC assessed with high confidence both that ecosystems in the permafrost region act as carbon sinks during the summer growing season, and that wintertime carbon losses are significant, consistent with a multi-decadal small increase in CO2 emissions during early winter at Barrow, Alaska. These findings have been further strengthened by recent comprehensive synthesis of in-situ wintertime flux observations that show large carbon losses during the non-growing season. Increased autumn and winter respiration are a key large-scale fingerprint of top-down permafrost thaw predicted by ecosystem models. However, the length of these wintertime observational records is too short to unequivocally determine whether winter carbon losses are higher now than they used to be. One study inferred a multi-year net CO2 source for the tundra in Alaska, which is equivalent to 0.3 PgC yr-1 when scaled up to the northern permafrost region. Since the AR5, evidence of a more active carbon cycle in the northern high latitude regions has also been observed through the increased amplitude of CO2 seasonal cycles. However, the relative roles of local sources versus influence from mid-latitudes makes it difficult to infer changes to Arctic ecosystems from these observations. Estimates of CO2 fluxes with atmospheric inversion models showed an enhanced seasonal cycle amplitude but no significant trends in annual total fluxes, in agreement with flux tower measurements over one decade. In addition to CO2, CH4 emissions from the northern permafrost region contribute to the global methane budget, but evidence as to whether these emissions have increased from thawing permafrost is mixed. SROCC assigned low confidence to the degree of recent additional methane emissions from diverse sources throughout the permafrost region. These include observed regional lake area change, which suggest a 1.65 Tg CH4 yr1 increase over the last 50 years, ice-capped geological sources, and shallow Arctic Ocean shelves. The shallow subsea emissions are particularly uncertain due to both the wide range of estimates (3 Tg CH4 yr1(Thornton et al., 2016a) to 17 Tg CH4 yr1), and the lack of a baseline with which to infer any changes; the upper half of this range in flux estimates is, however, inconsistent with the atmospheric inversions constrained by the pan-Arctic CH4 concentration measurements. Atmospheric measurements and inversions performed at the global and regional scales do not show any detectable trends in annual mean CH4 emissions from the permafrost region over the past 30 years, consistent with atmospheric measurements in Alaska that showed no significant annual trends despite significant increase in air temperature (Sweeney et"}

Gradual processes include the deepening of the seasonally-thawed active layer into perennially-frozen permafrost layers and lengthening of the thawed season within the active layer, which increases the amount of organic carbon that is thawed and the duration of thaw. Abrupt thaw processes include ice-wedge polygon degradation, hillslope collapse, thermokarst lake expansion and draining, all of which are processes largely occurring in regions with very high soil carbon content. Abrupt thaw processes can contribute up to half of the total net greenhouse gas release from permafrost loss, the rest attributed to gradual thaw. Increased fire frequency and severity also contributes to abrupt emissions and the removal of the insulating cover which leads to an acceleration of permafrost thaw. Ecological feedbacks can both mitigate and amplify carbon losses: nutrient release from increased organic matter decomposition can drive vegetation growth that partially offsets soil carbon losses, but also lead to biophysical feedbacks that further amplify warming. Through CMIP5, Earth system models had not included permafrost carbon dynamics. This remains largely true in CMIP6, with most models not representing permafrost carbon processes, a small number representing the active-layer thickening effect on decomposition, and no ESMs representing thermokarst or fire-permafrost-carbon interactions. The CMIP6 ensemble mean predicts a negative carbonclimate feedback in the permafrost region. However, those that do include permafrost carbon show a positive carbon-climate feedback in the permafrost region. Given the current limited ESM capacity to assess permafrost feedbacks, estimates in this report are based on published permafrost-enabled land surface model results. SROCC assessed that warming under a high emission scenario would result in a loss of permafrost carbon by 2100 of 10s to 100s of PgC, with a maximum estimate of 240 PgC and a best estimate of 92  17 PgC. Under lower emissions scenarios, Schneider von Deimling et al., estimated permafrost feedbacks of 2058 PgC of CO2 by 2100 under a RCP2.6 scenario, and 2892 PgC of CO2 under a RCP4.5 scenario. This new assessment, based on studies included in or published since SROCC, estimates that the permafrost CO2 feedback per degree of global warming is 18 PgC oC-1. The assessment is based on a wide range of scenarios evaluated at 2100, and an assessed estimate of the permafrost CH4-climate feedback at 2.8 Pg Ceq oC-1. This feedback affects the remaining carbon budgets for climate stabilisation and is included in their assessment. Beyond 2100, models suggest that the magnitude of the permafrost carbon feedback strengthens considerably over the period 21002300 under a high-emissions scenario. Schneider von Deimling et al., estimated that thawing permafrost could release 2040 PgC of CO2 in the period from 2100 to 2300 under a RCP2.6 scenario, and 115172 PgC of CO2 under a RCP8.5 scenario. The multi-model ensemble in project a much wider range of permafrost soil carbon losses of 81642 PgC for an RCP8.5 scenario from 2100 to 2300, and of a gain of 14 PgC to a loss of 54 PgC for an RCP4.5 scenario over the same period. Methane release from permafrost thaw under high-warming RCP8.5 scenario has been estimated at 8362614 Tg CH4 over the 21st century and 28007400 Tg CH4 from 21002300, and as 5300 Tg CH4 over the 21st century and 16000 Tg CH4 from 21002300. For RCP4.5, these numbers are 5382356 Tg CH4 until 2100 and 20006100 Tg CH4 from 21002300, and 4100 Tg CH4 until 2100 and 10000 Tg CH4 from 21002300. A key uncertainty is whether permafrost carbon feedbacks scale roughly linearly with warming (Koven et"}

It also remains unclear whether the permafrost carbon pool represents a coherent global tipping element of the Earth system with a single abrupt threshold at a given level of global warming, or a local scale tipping point without abrupt thresholds when aggregated across the pan-Arctic region as is suggested by recent model results (e.g.). In conclusion, thawing terrestrial permafrost will lead to carbon release under a warmer world. However, there is low confidence on the timing, magnitude and linearity of the permafrost climate feedback owing to the wide range of published estimates and the incomplete knowledge and representation in models of drivers and relationships. It is projected that CO2 released from permafrost will be 18 PgC per 1C by 2100 with the relative contribution of CO2 vs CH4 remaining poorly constrained. Permafrost carbon feedbacks are included among the underrepresented feedbacks quantified in Figure 5.29. 5.4.4 Climate Effects on Future Ocean Carbon Uptake 5.4.4.1 Physical Drivers of Future Ocean Carbon Uptake and Storage The principal contribution to increasing global ocean carbon is the air-sea flux of CO2, which changes the DIC inventory. The processes that influence the variability and trends of the ocean carbon-heat nexus are assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 5.3. Climate has three important impacts on the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2: ocean warming reduces the solubility of CO2, which increases pCO2 and increases the stratification of the mixed layer with both acting as positive feedbacks weakening the ocean sink; changing the temporal and spatial characteristics of wind stress and storm alters mixing  entrainment in the mixed layer and across the bottom of the mixed layer and both warming and wind stress influence the large scale MOC circulation which modifies the rate of ventilation, storage or outgassing of ocean carbon in the ocean interior. The land-to-ocean riverine flux and the carbon burial in ocean sediments also play a minor role. Based on high agreement of projections by coupled climate models, there is high confidence that the resultant climatecarbon cycle feedbacks are positive but the extent of the weakening the ocean sink is scenario dependent. Regionally, the Southern Ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic CO2, although challenges in modelling its circulation and Antarctic sea ice transport generate uncertainty in the response of its sink to future carbon-climate feedbacks. Increased freshwater input may cause a slowdown of the lower overturning circulation, leading to increased Southern Ocean biological carbon storage; alternatively, increased winds may intensify the overturning circulation, reducing the net CO2 sink in the Southern Ocean. On centennial timescales, there is thus low confidence in the overall effect of intensifying winds in the Southern Ocean on CO2 uptake. 5.4.4.2 Biological Drivers of Future Ocean Carbon Uptake While physical drivers control the present-day anthropogenic carbon sink, biological processes are responsible for the majority of the vertical gradient in DIC. A small fraction of the organic carbon fixed by primary production reaches the sea floor, where it can be stored in sediments on geological timescales, making the biological carbon pump an important mechanism for very longterm CO2 storage. Projected reductions in ocean ventilation would lengthen residence time and lead to DIC accumulating in the deep ocean due to organic carbon remineralisation."}

For each model, common historical land-use changes were prescribed. Figure 5.23 shows global annual mean values from CMIP6 concentration-driven runs for 1850 to 2014. The ocean carbon cycle models reproduce historical carbon uptake well, with the model range for the global ocean carbon sink in 2014 clustering around the central GCP estimate of 2.6  0.5 GtC yr1. Simulated cumulative ocean carbon uptake ranges from 110 to 166 GtC, with a model mean of 131  17 PgC which is lower than the GCP estimate of 150  25 GtC. This suggests that CMIP6 models may slightly underestimate historical ocean carbon uptake. The land carbon cycle components of historical ESM simulations show a larger range, with simulated cumulative land carbon uptake spanning the range from 47 to +21 GtC, compared to the GCP estimate of 12  50 GtC. This range is due in part to the complications of simulating the difference between carbon uptake by intact ecosystems and the direct release of carbon due to land-use change. There is high confidence that the land continues to dominate the overall uncertainty in the projected response of the global carbon cycle to climate change.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. 5.4.5.2 Evaluation of Latitudinal Distribution of Simulated Carbon Sinks This distinction between the relatively high fidelity with which the ocean carbon sink is simulated, and the much wider range of simulations of the land carbon sink, is also evident in the zonal distribution of the sinks. We compare the ESM simulations to estimates from three atmospheric inversion models: CAMS, CT 2017 and MIROC-ATM4. The ocean carbon cycle components of CMIP6 ESMs are able to simulate the tropical CO2 source and midlatitude CO2 sink, with relatively small model spread. The CMIP6 ensemble simulates a larger ocean carbon sink at 50oN and a weaker sink in the Southern Ocean, than the inversion estimate, but with some evidence of a reduction in these residual errors compared to CMIP5. The spread in inversion fluxes arises primarily from differences in the atmospheric CO2 measurement networks and from transport model uncertainties. It has been previously noted that AR5 models tended to overestimate land-uptake in the tropics and underestimate uptake in the northern mid-latitudes, compared to inversion estimates. The inclusion of nitrogen limitations on CO2-fertilisation within CMIP6 models was expected to reduce this discrepancy. There is indeed some evidence that the CMIP6 ensemble captures the northern land carbon sink more clearly than CMIP5, but there remains a tendency for the ESMs to place more of the global land carbon sink in the tropics than the midlatitudes, compared to the inversion estimates. Based on a consistent signal across CMIP6 ESMs, there is medium confidence that land carbon cycle models continue to underestimate the northern hemisphere land carbon sink, when compared to estimates from atmospheric inversion."}

As a result, the evolution of land and ocean carbon sinks differs significantly between the SSP scenarios. Under scenarios which have greater increases in atmospheric CO2 the absolute values of the sinks are larger, but the fraction of implied emissions taken-up by the sinks declines through the 21st century. By contrast, scenarios that assume CO2 stabilisation in the 21st century, have smaller absolute sinks but these sinks take-up an increasing fraction of the implied emissions. These general principles apply to both the ocean and land carbon sinks. The concentration-driven CMIP6 ESMs agree well on the evolution of the global ocean carbon sink through the 21st century for four SSP scenarios. The 5-year ensemble mean ocean sink declines to 0.6  0.2 GtC yr-1 by 2100 under SSP12.6, and peaks around 2080 at 5.4  0.4 GtC yr-1 under SSP58.5. Cumulative ocean carbon uptake from 1850 is projected to saturate at approximately 290  30 GtC under SSP12.6, and to reach 520  40 GtC by 2100 under SSP58.5. The ensemble mean changes in land and ocean sinks are qualitatively similar, but the land shows much higher interannual variability in carbon uptake and also a much larger spread in the model projections of cumulative land carbon uptake. The 5-year ensemble mean net land carbon sink is projected to decline to 0.4  1.0 GtC yr-1 by 2100 under SSP12.6, and to reach around 5.6  3.7 GtC yr-1 under SSP58.5. Cumulative net land carbon uptake from 1850 is projected to saturate at approximately 150  35 GtC under SSP12.6, and to reach 310  130 GtC by 2100 under SSP58.5. Significant uncertainty remains in the future of the global land carbon sink, but there has been a notable reduction in the model spread from CMIP5 to CMIP6.

In all scenarios the ocean sink is strongest in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic. The land carbon sink occurs primarily where there are present-day forests. In the midand high northern latitudes, a carbon sink is projected as a result of the combined impacts of increasing CO2 and warming. Changes in land carbon storage in the tropics also depend strongly on the assumed rate of deforestation which varies in magnitude across the SSPs, from relatively low rates in SSP12.6 to relatively high rates in SSP37.0. Figure 5.26: Maps of net carbon changes under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios, as evaluated from nine CMIP6 Earth system models. Uncertainty is represented using the simple approach: No overlay indicates regions with high model agreement, where 80% of models agree with the ensemble mean on the sign of change; diagonal lines indicate regions with low model agreement, where <80% of models agree with the ensemble mean on the sign of change. On land, this is calculated as the time integral of NBP, for the ocean it is the timeintegral of air-sea CO2 gas flux anomalies relative to the pre-industrial. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. In summary, oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks are projected to continue to grow with increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2, but the fraction of emissions that is taken up by land and ocean is expected to decline as the CO2 concentration increases. In the ensemble mean, ESMs suggest approximately equal global land and ocean carbon uptake for each of the SSP scenarios. However, the range of model projections is much larger for the land carbon sink. Despite the wide range of model responses, uncertainty in atmospheric CO2 by 2100 is dominated by future anthropogenic emissions rather than carbon-climate feedbacks. 5.4.5.4 Linear Feedback Analysis In order to diagnose the causes of the varying time-evolution of carbon sinks, the traditional linear feedback approach is adopted, as used previously to analyse C4MIP and CMIP5 models.

Since the AR5, a growing number of prediction systems have been developed based on ESMs that include the ocean and land carbon cycle components. Predictability of key physical climate variables provides a platform to establish predictive skill for interannual variations in the strength of the natural carbon sinks in response to internal climate variability. In most systems the carbon cycle components are only indirectly initialised and respond to the initialised climate variations. This subsection synthesises information on predictability of the land and ocean carbon sinks using both the idealised potential predictability and the actual predictability skill measures. Longer-term memory residing in the ocean enables predictability of the ocean carbon sink. The predictive horizon of the globally integrated air-sea CO2 fluxes has been assessed in perfect-model frameworks that are based on an idealised ensemble of simulations in which each ensemble member serves as a verification, while no observations are assessed. Perfect-model studies provide an estimate of the upper range of potential predictability for the integrated air-sea CO2 fluxes of about 2 years globally and up to a decade in some regions. Evidence is also emerging for predictive skill of the global air-sea CO2 fluxes of up to 6 years based-on prediction systems initialised with observed physical climate states, with a potential for even longerterm regional predictability in some regions including the North Atlantic and subpolar Southern Ocean. Models suggest that predictability of the air-sea CO2 flux is related to predictability of ocean biogeochemical state variables such as dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity, as well as the mixed layer depth. Temperature variations largely control shorter-term predictability of the ocean carbon sink, while longer term predictability is related to non-thermal drivers such as ocean circulation and biology. Although there is a substantial spatial heterogeneity, initialised predictions suggest stronger multi-year variations of the air-sea CO2 flux and generally tend to outperform uninitialized simulations on the global scale. The predictive skill of air-sea CO2 flux shows a consistent spatial pattern in different models despite the wide range of techniques used to assimilate observational information. ESM-based prediction systems also demonstrate predictability of other marine biogeochemical properties such as net primary production and seawater pH. Seasonal predictability of air-land CO2 flux up to 68 months is driven by the state of ENSO. Fewer land carbon initialised predictions are available from decadal prediction systems, yet they tend to outperform the uninitialized simulations in capturing the major year-to-year variations as indicated by higher correlations with the Global Carbon Budget estimates. There is growing evidence that potential predictive skill of air-land CO2 flux is maintained out to a lead-time of 2 years; this predictability horizon is also supported by perfect model studies. The origins of this interannual predictability are not yet fully"}

However, they seem to be associated with the oscillatory behaviour of ENSO and the predictability of terrestrial ecosystem drivers such as ecosystem respiration and gross primary production. Initialised simulations suggest that observed variability in the land carbon sink is improved through initialisation of prediction systems with the observed state of the physical climate. The predictability horizon of variations in atmospheric CO2 growth-rate are not yet fully established in the literature. However, predictive skill of the land and ocean carbon sinks show a potential to establish predictability of variations in atmospheric CO2 up to 2 years in advance in the initialised prediction systems with an upper bound of up to 3 years in a perfect-model study; this skill is primarily limited by the terrestrial carbon sink predictability. 5.5 Remaining Carbon Budgets Science at the time of the IPCC AR5 established a near-linear relationship between cumulative emissions of CO2 and the resulting global warming. The amount of global warming per unit of cumulated CO2 emissions is called the transient climate response to cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide. This TCRE relationship is now used to estimate the amount of CO2 emissions that would be consistent with limiting global warming to specific levels. The remainder of CO2 emissions that would be in line with limiting global warming to a specific temperature level can be estimated with help of the TCRE and is referred to as the remaining carbon budget. Section 5.5.1 first assesses the TCRE as one of the core concepts underlying the notion of a remaining carbon budget and Section 5.5.2 then integrates this with the assessment of other contributing factors from across this assessment to provide a consolidated assessment following the approach of the IPCC SR1.5. The historical carbon budget of CO2 already emitted is assessed in Section 5.2.1.5. 5.5.1 Transient Climate Response to Cumulative Emissions of carbon dioxide 5.5.1.1 Contributing Physical Processes and Theoretical Frameworks The processes that translate emissions of CO2 into a change in global temperature are governed by complex mechanisms that all evolve in time. Starting with an initial description in AR5 a body of literature has since expanded the understanding of physical mechanisms from which a simple proportional relationship between cumulative emissions of CO2 and change in global temperature arises. Studies have focused on two key features of the TCRE relationship: why the relationship is nearly constant in time; and why and under which conditions the relationship is independent on the historical rate of CO2 emissions. There is increased confidence in the near-constancy of TCRE because of the variety of methods that have been used to examine this relationship: sensitivity studies with Earth system models of EMICs; theory-based equations used to examine Earth system model and EMIC output; and simple analytical models that capture aspects of the TCRE relationship. All studies agree that the near-constancy of the TCRE arises from compensation between the diminishing sensitivity of radiative"}

The question whether and under which conditions the TCRE relationship is independent of the historical rate of CO2 emissions has been examined by using simple mathematically-tractable models. Based on the assumption that the cumulative fraction of carbon taken up by the terrestrial biosphere is constant, and that the climate feedback parameter and ocean heat uptake efficacy do not change in time, both studies agree that pathway independence is sensitive to the rate of CO2 emissions, such that pathway independence is expected to breakdown at both very high and very low absolute CO2 emission rates. Note that in pathways with strongly declining emissions, the cumulative sink fraction by the combined terrestrial biosphere and ocean is expected to increase. The studies also agree that no similar relationship analogous to TCRE can be expected for short-lived non-CO2 forcers, for which the annual emissions are a closer proxy for the implied warming; Sections 6.4, 7.6. MacDougall, suggests that two additional constraints are required to create pathway independence: first, the transport of heat and carbon into the deep ocean should be governed by processes with similar timescales; and second, the ratio of the net change in the atmospheric carbon pool to the net change in the ocean carbon pool should be close to the ratio of the enhanced longwave radiation to space to ocean heat uptake. If these ratios are identical then TCRE would be completely path independent. If the ratios are close but not identical, TCRE would be only approximately path independent over a wide range of cumulative emissions. The land carbon cycle does not appear to play a fundamental role in the origin of the linearity and pathindependence of TCRE, but, in contrast to the ocean sink, dominates the uncertainty in the magnitude of TCRE by modulating the cumulative airborne fraction of carbon. Some terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks have the potential to alter both the linearity and pathway independence of TCRE, if such feedbacks significantly contribute carbon to the atmosphere. A recent study also shows how the value of TCRE can depend on the effect of ocean ventilation modulating ocean heat uptake.

Monteiro, Jean-Baptiste Sallee, Piers Foster, Baylor Fox-Kemper, Helen Hewitt, Masao Ishii, Joeri Rogelj, Kirsten Zickfeld Context In the past 60 years the ocean has taken up and stored 23  5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions as well as more than 90% of the heat that has accumulated in the Earth system since the 1970s. The interplay between heat and CO2 uptake by the ocean has not only played a major role in slowing the rate of global warming but provides a first order influence in determining the unique properties of a metric of the coupled climate-carbon cycle response, transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions, which is critical to setting the future remaining carbon emissions budget. This role of the ocean in the uptake of heat and anthropogenic CO2 and related feedbacks is what we term here the Ocean Heat-Carbon Nexus. The ocean"}

In this box, we assess the role of the ocean and its physical and chemical thermodynamic processes that shape these striking characteristics. The role of the ocean in setting the coupled climate-carbon cycle response is threefold: firstly, the ocean and land carbon sinks together set the airborne fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere, which sets the radiative forcing that drives the additional heat in the atmosphere most of which is taken up by the ocean. However, the land carbon sink does not appear to play an important role in determining the linearity and path-independence of TCRE. Secondly, the ocean sets the thermal response through ocean heat uptake. Thirdly, there is a feedback within the ocean heat-carbon nexus as ocean warming, particularly under low or no mitigation scenarios weakens the ocean sink of CO2, which influences the AF, and hence the radiative forcing. The near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and global warming is thought to arise to a large extent from the compensation between the decreasing ability of the ocean to take up heat and CO2 at higher cumulative CO2 emissions, pointing to similar processes that determine ocean uptake of heat and carbon. Processes the drive the Ocean Carbon Heat Nexus and its change The air-sea flux of heat and all gases across the ocean interface is driven by a common set of complex and difficult to observe turbulent diffusion and mixing processes. These processes are typically simplified into widely verified expressions that link the flux to wind stress, the solubility and the gradient across the airsea interface. Because the ocean has a higher heat capacity than the atmosphere, the partitioning of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean is primarily influenced by the temperature differences between air and seawater. Similarly, the unique seawater carbonate buffering capacity, enables CO2 to be stored in the ocean as dissolved salts, rather than just as dissolved gas, which increases the capacity of seawater to store CO2 by two orders of magnitude beyond the solubility of CO2 gas and approximate the partitioning ratio of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean. The role of the biological carbon pump in influencing the ocean sink of anthropogenic carbon into the ocean interior is assessed to be minimal during the historical period but this may change, particularly in regional contexts, by 2100. Its role is important in the natural or pre-industrial carbon cycle. Under climate change, the buffering capacity of the ocean decreases, which reflects a decreasing capacity for the ocean to take up additional anthropogenic CO2 and store it in the DIC reservoir. In contrast to CO2, there is no physical limitation that would reduce the ability of surface ocean temperature to equilibrate with the atmospheric temperature. However, both carbon and heat fluxes depend on air-sea heat fluxes that depend on gradients of characteristics at the air-sea interface. These gradients at the air-sea interface respond to ocean dynamics, such as the volume of the surface mixed-layer that equilibrates with the atmosphere, and ocean circulation that can flush the surface layer with water-masses that have not equilibrated with the atmosphere for a long time. Limited recent evidence has suggested that the effect of small-scale dynamics absent in climate and earth system models might be locally important in this regard. In summary, changes in heat and carbon uptake by the ocean rely on a combination of unique chemical and shared physical processes any of which have the potential to disrupt the coherence of heat and CO2 change in the ocean."}

This behaviour is confirmed in other studies, including those that calculate the temperature response to an instantaneous doubling or quadrupling of atmospheric CO2. These findings suggest that the TCRE is sensitive to the rate of emissions, but studies assessing this sensitivity have found diverging results. For example, an increase in TCRE and its surrounding uncertainty was reported for experiments that imply a gradual decline in annual CO2 emissions. These studies suggest that in most cases TCRE would be expected to increase in scenarios with decreasing annual emissions rates. This increase in TCRE for annual CO2 emissions declining towards zero can be the result of the zero emissions commitment which is the amount of warming projected to occur following a complete cessation of emissions, as well as Earth system processes that are unrepresented in current TCRE estimates and other factors. When using TCRE to estimate CO2 emissions consistent with a specific maximum warming level these factors have to be taken into account. Combined with recent literature on the ZEC and emissions pathways and noting the lack of literature that disentangles these various contributions, there is medium evidence and high agreement resulting in medium confidence that TCRE remains a good predictor of CO2-induced warming when applied in the context of emission reduction pathways, provided that ZEC and long-term Earth system feedbacks are adequately accounted for when emissions decline towards zero. 5.5.1.2.3 Reversibility and Earth System Feedbacks There are relatively few studies that have assessed how the TCRE is expected to change in scenarios of declining emissions followed by net negative annual CO2 emissions. Conceptually, the literature suggests that the small lag of about a decade between CO2 emissions and temperature change would result in more warming at a given amount of cumulative emissions in a scenario where that emission level is first exceeded and then returned to by deploying negative emissions (referred to as an overshoot, as is often the case in scenarios that aim to limit radiative forcing in 2100 to 2.6 or 1.9 W/m2. Zickfeld et al. showed this to hold across a range of scenarios with positive emissions followed by negative emissions, whereby the TCRE increased by about 10% across the transition from positive to negative emissions as a result of the thermal and carbon inertia of the deep ocean. However, CMIP6 results for the SSP53.4-overshoot scenario show diverging trends across various ESMs. In an idealised CO2concentration-driven setting Tachiiri et al. also reported an increase in TCRE. Exploring pathways with emissions rates and overshoots closer to mitigation pathways considered over the 21st century, a recent emission-driven EMIC experiment showed pathway independence of TCRE. Furthermore, also in absence of net negative emissions, warming would not necessarily remain perfectly constant on timescales of centuries and millennia, but could both decrease or increase. These additional changes in global mean temperature increase at various timescales are known as the ZEC, assessed in Section 4.7.2, and have to be integrated when using TCRE to estimate warming or remaining carbon budgets in overshoot scenarios. The AR5-assessed TCRE range was based in part on the ESMs available at the time, which did not include some potentially important Earth system feedbacks. Since then, a number of studies"}

This section provides an assessment of remaining carbon budgets consistent with the AR6 Glossary definition. Given that some feedbacks are time dependent, the values in this section apply to limiting warming over the 21st century, consistent with recent studies highlighting the usefulness of timelimited carbon budgets. Irrespective of the exact definition of the remaining carbon budget, the finding that higher cumulative CO2 emissions lead to higher temperatures implies that annual net CO2 emissions have to decline to close to zero in order to halt global warming, whether at 1.5C, 2C or another level. Two approaches were used in AR5 to determine carbon budgets. Working group I reported threshold exceedance budgets that correspond to the amount of cumulative CO2 emissions at the time a specific temperature threshold is exceeded with a given probability in a particular greenhouse-gas and aerosol emission scenario. WGI also reported TEBs for the hypothetical case that only CO2 would be emitted by human activities. AR5 Working group III used threshold avoidance budgets that correspond to the cumulative CO2 emissions over a given time period of a subset of greenhouse-gas and aerosol emission scenarios in which global-mean temperature increase stays below a specific temperature threshold with at least a given probability. The AR5 synthesis report used TABs defined until the time of peak warming over the 21st century. Drawbacks have been identified for both TEBs and TABs. TABs provide an estimate of the cumulative CO2 emissions under pathways that have as a common characteristic that they do not exceed a specific global warming threshold. The actual level of maximum warming can however vary between pathways, leading to an unnecessary and poorly constrained spread in TAB estimates. The TAB approach does therefore typically not result in accurate projections of the remaining carbon budget. On the other hand, a drawback of TEBs is that they provide an estimate of the cumulative CO2 emissions at the time global warming crosses a given threshold of interest in a specific emissions scenario, for example, most of the standard scenarios used in climate change research such as the RCPs or SSP-based scenarios exceed global warming of 1.5C or 2C. Because of potential variations in non-CO2 warming at that point in time or potential lags of about a decade in CO2 warming TEBs also do not provide a precise estimate of the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to a specific level. Since the publication of AR5, several new approaches have been proposed that provide a solution to the identified limitations of TABs and TEBs. Most of these approaches indirectly rely on the concept of TCRE, for example, because they estimate modelled cumulative CO2 emissions until a temperature threshold is crossed and use this budget to infer insights for pathways which attempt to limit warming to below this threshold and thus need to follow a different path. In this report, the assessment framework of the IPCC SR1.5 for remaining carbon budgets is applied. This framework allows to integrate multiple lines of evidence to assess the contributions of five components that together result in a consolidated assessment of the remaining carbon budget. It builds on the advances in estimating remaining carbon budgets or related quantities that have been published since AR5. Recent studies suggest further changes to this framework by including non-linear adjustments to the TCRE contribution, or including non-CO2 forcers in different ways by accounting for their different forcing effects. Figure 5.31 provides a conceptual schematic of how the various individually assessed contributions are combined into a consolidated assessment of the remaining carbon budget. Together with estimates of historical CO2 emissions to date, these remaining carbon budgets provide the overall amount of cumulative CO2 emissions consistent with limiting global"}

Based on the assessment in Section 3.3, we here apply an assessed best-estimate historical warming estimate expressed in global average surface air temperatures of 1.07C between 18501900 and 20102019. This choice implies global coverage and is consistent with AR5 where carbon budgets were reported in GSAT, the SR1.5 where GSAT was the central metric for remaining carbon budgets and recent studies that highlight how GSAT enables an easy translation with AR5. The use of other historical reference periods or temperature metrics and updated data products can result in a different estimated historical warming and thus a changed remaining carbon budget. 5.5.2.2.3 Non-CO2 Warming Contribution Non-CO2 emissions contribute either cumulatively or in proportion to their annual emissions to global warming, and thus also affect estimates of remaining carbon budgets by reducing the amount of warming that could still result from CO2 emissions. The size of this contribution has been estimated both implicitly and explicitly by varying the assumptions of non-CO2 emissions and associated warming. Internally consistent evolutions of future CO2 and non-CO2 emissions allow to derive non-CO2 warming contributions consistent with global CO2 emissions reaching net zero levels and therewith capping maximum future CO2 emissions. Pathways that reflect such development typically show a stabilisation or decline in non-CO2 radiative forcing and warming at and after the time of global CO2 emissions reaching net zero levels, as illustrated in the scenario database underlying the IPCC SR1.5. The impact of non-CO2 emissions on remaining carbon budgets is assessed with emulators that incorporate synthesised climate and carbon-cycle knowledge. The estimated implied non-CO2 warming can subsequently be applied to reduce the remaining allowable warming for estimating the remaining carbon budget. Alternative methods estimate the non-CO2 fraction of total anthropogenic forcing, or do not correct for non-CO2 warming directly. The latter methods instead consider CO2 and non-CO2 warming together to define a CO2 forcing equivalent carbon budget from which eventual non-CO2 contributions expressed in CO2-forcing-equivalent emissions have to be subtracted to obtain a remaining carbon budget. These studies also use emulators to invert a specified evolution of non-CO2 forcing to a corresponding amount of equivalent CO2 emissions, or alternatively use empirical relationships linking changes in non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions to warming. Methods to express non-CO2 emissions in CO2 equivalence are assessed in Section 7.6, yet their applicability and related uncertainties for remaining carbon budgets have not yet been covered in-depth in the literature. Application of the SR1.5 method with AR6-calibrated emulators suggests a median additional non-CO2 warming contribution at the time global CO2 emissions reach net zero levels of about 0.10.2C relative to 20102019. Uncertainty surrounding this range due to geophysical uncertainties such as non-CO2 forcing uncertainties and TCR is of the order of 0.1C. Differences in the choices of mitigation strategies considered in low-emission scenarios result in a potential additional variation around the central range of at least 0.1C."}

Based on the ZEC assessment presented in Section 4.7.2, the ZECs central value is taken to be zero with a likely range of 0.19C, noting that it might either increase or decrease after half a century. ZEC uncertainty is assessed for a time frame of half a century, as this most appropriately reflects the time between the time stringent mitigation pathways reach net zero CO2 emissions and the end of the century. For shorter time horizons, a similar central zero value applies, but with a smaller range. Experiments that ramped up and down emissions following a bell-shaped trajectory show that when annual CO2 emissions decline to zero at a pace consistent with those currently assumed in mitigation scenarios, the ZEC will already be realised to a large degree at the time of reaching net zero CO2 emissions. 5.5.2.2.5 Adjustments for Other not Represented Feedbacks Section 5.5.1.2 highlighted recent literature describing potential impacts of Earth system feedbacks that have typically not been included in standard ESMs, the most important of which is carbon release from thawing permafrost. The IPCC SR1.5 estimated unrepresented Earth system processes to result in a reduction of remaining carbon budgets of up to 100 GtCO2 over the course of this century, and more thereafter. Here this assessment is updated based on the Earth system feedback assessment of Section 5.4.8 and synthesised in Figure 5.29 by applying the reverse method by. The assessment in Section 5.4 and Box 5.1 highlights the different nature, magnitude and uncertainties surrounding additional Earth system feedback. The remaining carbon budgets reported in Table 5.8 account for these feedbacks, including corrections due to permafrost CO2 and CH4 feedbacks as well as those due to aerosol and atmospheric chemistry. Two of these additional feedbacks are included in the projections of non-CO2 warming carried out with AR6calibrated emulators. The remainder of these independent Earth system feedbacks combine to a feedback of about 7  27 PgC K-1. Overall, Section 5.4.8 assessed there to be low confidence in the exact magnitude of these feedbacks and they represent identified additional amplifying factors that scale with additional warming and mostly increase the challenge of limiting global warming to or below specific temperature levels. 5.5.2.3 Remaining Carbon Budget The combination of the five components assessed in Sections 5.5.2.2.15.5.2.2.5 allows for an overall assessment of the remaining carbon budget in line with different levels of global average warming, as documented in the IPCC SR1.5. The overall assessment of remaining carbon budgets reflects the uncertainty in TCRE quantification and provides estimates of the uncertainties surrounding the contributions of each of the respective further components. A formal combination of all uncertainties is not possible because they are not all independent or because they represent choices rather than probabilistic uncertainties. In light of all uncertainties related to TCRE, nonCO2 forcing and response, the level of non-CO2 mitigation, and historical warming, there is a small probability that the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5C since the 18501900 period is effectively zero. However, applying best estimate values for all but uncertainties in Earth system feedbacks and TCRE, the remaining carbon budgets in line with the Paris Agreement are generally small yet not zero. There is robust evidence supporting the concept of TCRE as well as high confidence in the range of historical human-induced warming.

Since AR5, strengths and weaknesses of various approaches have been more clearly articulated in the literature (e.g., in), resulting in a new consolidated framework applied in SR1.5 that is also used in AR6. This framework incorporates five methodological advancements compared to AR5, the implications of which are discussed in this box. First, publications since AR5 applied methods that limit the effect of uncertainties in historical, diagnosed emissions in coupled Earth system models on estimates of the remaining carbon budget. These new methods express remaining carbon budget estimates relative to a recent reference period instead of relative to pre-industrial. Estimates of the full carbon budget since pre-industrial can still be obtained by adding estimates of historical CO2 emissions to estimates in Table 5.8. This methodological update resulted, all other aspects being equal, in median estimates of remaining carbon budgets being about 350450 GtCO2 larger compared to AR5. At the time of the AR5, CMIP5 provided global mean surface air temperature projections for the representative concentration pathways, which were used to determine carbon budgets while taking into account the effects of non-CO2 forcers. Their use came with two recognised limitations: first, the model spread of the CMIP5 ensemble represents an ensemble of opportunity with limited statistical value; and second, the evolution of non-CO2 emissions as a function of cumulative CO2 emissions can differ markedly between high and low emissions pathways. Solutions to these two limitations have been published since AR5 and represent the second and third methodological improvement compared to AR5. The reliance on an ensemble of opportunity is avoided by methodologically separating the assessment of future warming contributions of non-CO2 emissions from the spread in TCRE. This facilitates the explicit representation of TCRE uncertainty by a formal distribution, in this case a normal distribution with a 1.02.3C PgC-1 1sigma range. The effect of this methodological advance can be estimated from a direct comparison of the frequency distribution of TCRE in CMIP5 models that were used in AR5 and the formal TCRE distribution used in AR6, but is limited in precision. For estimates of the remaining carbon budget in line with limiting warming to 1.5C or 2C relative to pre-industrial levels, this improvement is estimated to lead to a reduction of budgets of the order of about 100 GtCO2 between AR5 and AR6. The third methodological improvement is a more direct estimation of the warming contribution of non-CO2 emissions, consistent with pathways that bring global CO2 emissions down to net zero. Instead of deriving this contribution implicitly from the CMIP5 ensemble, climate emulators that are calibrated to the combined AR6 assessment are used to estimate the non-CO2 contribution across a wide variety of stringent mitigation"}

The specific relative effect of this advance compared to AR5 is not calculable because CMIP5 data does not isolate non-CO2 from CO2-induced warming. The fourth and fifth methodological advancements are to explicitly account for the zero-emission commitment and adjust estimates for Earth system feedbacks that are typically not represented in Earth System models. The central estimate of the assessed ZEC used in SR1.5 and AR6 is zero. ZEC uncertainties are reported separately, and the additional consideration of ZEC therefore does result in a better understanding but not in a net shift of central estimates of the remaining carbon budget compared to AR5. Furthermore, AR5 did not explicitly account for Earth system feedbacks not represented in Earth system models. SR1.5 assessed that they could reduce the remaining carbon budgets by about 100 GtCO2 over centennial timescales. This assessment has been updated in AR6, including a wider range of biogeochemical feedbacks and new evidence. Some of these feedbacks are captured in the estimation of non-CO2 warming, while the combined effect of remaining positive and negative feedbacks is assessed to reduce the remaining carbon budget estimates by 7  27 PgC K-1 compared to AR5. Between SR1.5 and AR6, each of the five components described in Section 5.5.2.1 and Figure 5.32 have been re-assessed. Their updated assessments in turn affect the assessment of the remaining carbon budget. The new and narrower assessment of TCRE in AR6 compared to SR1.5 leads to no change in median estimates and about a 50 and 100 GtCO2 increase in remaining carbon budgets estimates at the 67th percentile in AR6 compared to SR1.5 for 1.5C and 2C of global warming, respectively. For historical warming, SR1.5 used GSAT increase between 18501900 and 20062015 of 0.97C as its main starting point, while also providing values for other temperature metrics. Remaining carbon budgets were expressed starting from 1 January 2018 by accounting for historical emissions emitted from 1 January 2011 until the end of 2017. AR6 uses anthropogenic warming until the 20102019 period, which is assessed at the 0.8-1.3C range, with a best estimate of 1.07C, and subsequently accounts for historical emissions from 1 January 2015 until the end of 2019 to express remaining carbon budget estimates from 1 January 2020 onwards. The human-induced warming between the 18501900 and 20062015 periods used in SR1.5 was assessed by AR6 at 0.97C. In a like-with-like comparison, the combined effect of data and methodological updates in historical warming estimates thus results in no shift in estimated remaining carbon budgets between SR1.5 and AR6. However, the emissions of the years passed since SR1.5 reduce the remaining carbon budget by about 85 GtCO2. Note that AR6 also updated its GSAT assessment for total warming between the 18501900 and 20062015 periods, reporting 0.94C of warming. On a like-with-like basis, this would have resulted in slightly larger remaining carbon budgets compared to SR1.5. The non-CO2 contribution to future warming in emissions scenarios is re-assessed with AR6-calibrated emulators, in this case MAGICC7. The re-assessment of non-CO2 warming with MAGICC7 results in a relationship that closely matches the average relationship applied in SR1.5 (shown in Section 2.SM.1.1.2 in), and does therefore not change estimates of the remaining carbon budget relative to SR1.5. The median ZEC assessment remained the same between SR1.5 and AR6, and therefore also does not change the median remaining carbon budget estimates. Finally, as indicated above, AR6 expanded the assessment of Earth system feedbacks compared to SR1.5 and included it in its central remaining carbon budget estimates. Some feedbacks are accounted for through the non-CO2 warming estimate, while the remainder combines to reduce the median remaining carbon budget estimates for 1.5C and 2C of warming by about 10 to 20 GtCO2, respectively, compared to SR1.5. All methodological improvements and new evidence combined result in median and 67th percentile remaining carbon budget estimates for limiting warming to 1.5C being about 300350 GtCO2 larger compared to an assessment that would use the evidence and methods available at the time of the AR5. For limiting warming to 2C, the difference is about 400500 GtCO2. Since SR1.5, fewer key advancements had"}

In a like-with-like comparison, the combined effects of all AR6 updates result in median remaining carbon budget estimates for limiting warming to 1.5C and 2C being the same and about 60 GtCO2 smaller, respectively, in AR6 compared to SR1.5. At the 67th percentile, remaining carbon budget estimates for limiting warming to 1.5C and 2C are about 40 to 60 GtCO2 larger, respectively, mainly as a result of a narrower assessed TCRE range. 5.6 Biogeochemical Implications of Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar Radiation Modification 5.6.1 Introduction Carbon dioxide removal refers to anthropogenic activities that seek to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and durably store it in geological, terrestrial or ocean reservoirs, or in products. CO2 is removed from the atmosphere by enhancing biological or geochemical carbon sinks or by direct capture of CO2 from air and storage. Solar radiation modification, on the other hand, refers to the intentional, planetary-scale modification of the Earths radiative budget with the aim of limiting global warming. Most proposed SRM methods involve reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation reaching the surface, but others also act on the longwave radiation budget by reducing optical thickness and cloud lifetime. SRM does not fall within the IPCC definitions of mitigation and adaptation. CDR and SRM are referred to as geoengineering in some of the literature and are considered separately in this report. This section assesses the implications of CDR and SRM for biogeochemical cycles. CDR has received growing interest as an important mitigation option in emission scenarios consistent with meeting the Paris Agreement climate goals. The climate effects of CDR and SRM are assessed in Chapter 4, and a detailed assessment of the socio-economic dimensions of these options is presented in AR6 WGIII, Chapters 7 and 12. 5.6.2 Biogeochemical Responses to Carbon Dioxide Removal The scope of this section is to assess the general and methods-specific effects of CDR on the global carbon cycle and other biogeochemical cycles. The focus is on Earth system feedbacks that either amplify or reduce carbon sequestration potentials of specific CDR methods, and determine their effectiveness in reducing atmospheric CO2 and mitigating climate change. Technical carbon sequestration potentials of CDR methods are assessed on a qualitative scale; a comprehensive quantitative assessment is left to the AR6 Working Group III report. Biogeochemical and biophysical side effects of CDR methods are assessed here while the co-benefits and trade-offs for biodiversity, water and food production are briefly discussed for completeness, but a comprehensive assessment is left to WGII and WGIII. The assessment in this chapter emphasises literature published since the AR5 WGI report for the assessment of the global carbon cycle response to CDR, and literature published since the IPCC SR1.5, SRCCL and SROCC for the assessment of potentials and side effects of specific CDR methods. Emerging literature on deliberate methane removal is also briefly discussed. In this chapter, CDR methods are categorised by the carbon cycle processes that result in CO2 removal: enhanced net biological production and storage by land ecosystems, enhanced net biological production and storage in the open and coastal ocean, enhanced geochemical processes on land and in the ocean, and direct air capture and storage by chemical processes. A subset of CDR methods that restore or sustainably manage natural or modified ecosystems while providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits are also referred to as natural or nature-based solutions. CDR methods commonly discussed in the literature are summarised in Table 5.9. Other CDR options have been suggested, but there is insufficient literature for an assessment."}

As CDR and other mitigation activities are ramped up, CO2 emissions in these scenarios reach net zero and, as removals exceed emissions, become net negative. Studies exploring the carbon sink response to such scenarios show that when net CO2 emissions are positive, but start to decline, uptake of CO2 by the land and ocean begins to weaken (compare land and ocean CO2 fluxes in panels and of Figure 5.33). During the first decades after CO2 emissions become net negative, both the ocean and land carbon sinks continue to take up CO2, albeit at a lower rate. For the land carbon sink, the sink-to-source transition occurs decades to a century after CO2 emissions become net negative (Figure"}

The ocean remains a sink of CO2 for centuries after emissions become net negative. Whether the transition to source occurs at all, the timing of the transition and the magnitude of the CO2 source are determined by the magnitude of the removal and the rate and amount of net CO2 emissions prior to emissions becoming net negative. For scenarios with large amounts of CO2 removal such as SSP53.4overshoot the land source is larger than for SSP12.6 and the ocean also turns into a source. While the qualitative response to scenarios with net-negative emissions is largely robust across models, the timing of the sink-to-source transition and the magnitude of the CO2 source vary between models, particularly for the land sink. Due to limited agreement between models there is low confidence in the timing of the sink-tosource transition and the magnitude of the CO2 source in scenarios with net-negative CO2 emissions.

Net CO2 emissions, land and ocean CO2 fluxes represent the multimodel mean and standard deviation of four ESMs and one EMIC (UVic ESCM;). Net CO2 emissions are calculated from concentration-driven Earth system model simulations as the residual from the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 and land and ocean CO2 fluxes. Fluxes are accumulated over each 50-year period and converted to concentration units. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. 5.6.2.1.3 Removal Effectiveness of CDR It is well understood that land and ocean carbon fluxes are sensitive to the level of atmospheric CO2 and climate change and differ under different future scenarios. It is therefore important to establish to what extent the removal effectiveness of CDR  here defined as the fraction of total CO2 removed remaining out of the atmosphere  is dependent on the scenario from which CDR is applied. Different metrics have been proposed to quantify the removal effectiveness of CDR. One is the airborne fraction of cumulative CO2 emissions, defined in the same way as for positive emissions, with its use extended to periods of declining and net negative CO2 emissions. This metric, however, has not proven to be useful to quantify the removal effectiveness of CDR in simulations where CDR is applied from a trajectory of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, as it measures the carbon cycle response to CDR as well as to the prior atmospheric CO2 trajectory. A more useful metric is the perturbation airborne fraction, which measures the airborne fraction of the perturbation relative to a reference scenario. The advantage of this metric is that it isolates the response to a CO2 removal from the response to atmospheric CO2 prior to the point in time the removal is applied. A disadvantage is that the PAF cannot be calculated from a single model simulation but requires a reference simulation relative to which the effect of the CO2 removal can be evaluated. When CDR is applied from an equilibrium state, the PAF and AF are equivalent measures. In scenario simulations and idealised simulations with instantaneous CO2 removals applied from an equilibrium state, the removal effectiveness of CDR is found to be slightly dependent on the rate and amount of CDR, and to be strongly dependent on the emission scenario from which CDR is applied. The fraction of CO2 removed remaining out of the atmosphere decreases slightly for larger removals and decreases strongly when CDR is applied from a lower background atmospheric CO2 concentration (Figure"}

The rational for this focus builds on their high carbon stocks and rates of sequestration, high resilience to disturbances, and more additional benefits such as enhanced biodiversity. The global sequestration potential of forestation varies substantially depending on the scenario-assumptions of available land and of background climate. Afforestation of native grasslands, savannas, and open-canopy woodlands leads to the undesirable loss of unique natural ecosystems with rich biodiversity, carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Comprehensive approaches to assess the effectiveness of land-based carbon removal options need to be based on the whole carbon cycle covering both carbon stocks and flows, and establishing the links between human activities and their impacts on the biosphere and atmosphere. A range of mechanisms could enhance CO2 sequestration of forest-based methods under future scenarios, including CO2 fertilisation, soil carbon enrichment due to enhanced litter input, or the northward shift of the tree-line in future climate projection. There is low confidence in the net direction of feedbacks of afforestation on global mean temperature. The feedbacks are highly region dependent. For instances, afforestation at high latitudes would decrease albedo and increase local warming, while at low latitudes, the cooling effect of enhanced evapotranspiration could exceed the warming effect due to albedo decrease. Both afforestation and reforestation affect the hydrological cycle through increased VOC emissions and cloud albedo, enhanced precipitation and increased transpiration, with potential effects on runoff and, especially in dry areas, on water supply. Forest-based methods can either raise or lower N2O emissions, depending on tree species, previous land use, soil type and climatic factors . Afforestation will decrease biodiversity if native species are replaced by monocultures, while there is medium confidence that biodiversity is improved when forests are introduced into land areas with degraded soils or intensive monocultures, or where native species are re-introduced into managed land. Soil carbon losses from human agriculture accounted for about 116 PgC in the last 12,000 years,. With best management practices, two-thirds of these losses may be recoverable, setting a theoretical maximum of 77 PgC that can be sequestered in soils. Methods to increase soil carbon content may be applied to the restoration of marginal or degraded land, but may also be used in traditional agricultural lands. A simple practice is to increase the input of carbon to the soil by selecting appropriate varieties or species with greater root mass or higher yields and NPP. In addition, improved agricultural practices also increase soil carbon content. These include the use of crop rotation cycles, increase the amount of crop residues, use of crop cover to prevent periods of bare soil, optimisation of grazing and residue management, use of irrigation, employment of low-tillage or no-tillage, agroforestry, and cropland nutrient recycling, and avoid grassland conversion management. With medium confidence, methods which seek soil carbon sequestration will diminish N2O emissions and nutrient leaching, and improve soil fertility and biological activity. However, if improved soil carbon sequestration practices involve higher fertilisation rates, N2O emissions would increase. Some soil carbon sequestration methods, such as cover crops and crop diversity, can increase biodiversity. Biochar is produced by burning biomass at high temperatures under anoxic conditions and can, when added to soils, increase soil carbon stocks and fertility for decades to centuries (Woolf et al., 2010;"}

In the Arctic, large amounts of organic carbon are stored in permafrost  ground that remains frozen throughout the year. If significant areas of permafrost thaw as the climate warms, some of that carbon may be released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide or methane, resulting in additional warming. Projections from models of permafrost ecosystems suggest that future permafrost thaw will lead to some additional warming  enough to be important, but not enough to lead to a runaway warming situation, where permafrost thaw leads to a dramatic, self-reinforcing acceleration of global warming. The Arctic is the biggest climate-sensitive carbon pool on Earth, storing twice as much carbon in its frozen soils, or permafrost, than is currently stored in the atmosphere. As the Arctic region warms faster than anywhere else on earth, there are concerns that this warming could release greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and therefore significantly amplify climate change. The carbon in the permafrost has built up over thousands of years, as dead plants have been buried and accumulated within layers of frozen soil, where the cold prevents the organic material from decomposing. As the Arctic warms and soils thaw, the organic matter in these soils begins to decompose rapidly and return to the atmosphere as either carbon dioxide or methane, which are both important greenhouse gases. Permafrost can also thaw abruptly in a given place, due to melting ice in the ground reshaping Arctic landscapes, lakes growing and draining, and fires burning away insulating surface soil layers. Thawing of permafrost carbon has already been observed in the Arctic, and climate models project that much of the shallow permafrost throughout the Arctic would thaw under moderate to high amounts of global warming. While permafrost processes are complex, they are beginning to be included in models that represent the interactions between the climate and the carbon cycle. The projections from these permafrost carbon models show a wide range in the estimated strength of a carbonclimate vicious circle, from both carbon dioxide and methane, equivalent to 14175 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide released per 1C of global warming. By comparison, in 2019, human activities have released about 40 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has two implications. First, the extra warming caused by permafrost thawing is strong enough that it must be considered when estimating the total amount of remaining emissions permitted to stabilise the climate at a given level of global warming. Second, the models do not identify any one amount of warming at which permafrost thaw becomes a tipping point or threshold in the climate system that would lead to a runaway global warming. However, models do project that emissions would continuously increase with warming, and that this trend could last for hundreds of years. Permafrost can also be found in other cold places, but those places contain much less carbon than in the Arctic. For instance, the Tibetan plateau contains about 3% as much carbon as is stored in the Arctic. There is also concern about carbon frozen in shallow ocean sediments. These deposits are known as methane hydrates or clathrates, which are methane molecules locked within a cage of ice molecules. They formed as frozen soils that were flooded when sea levels rose after the last ice age. If these hydrates thaw, they may release methane that can bubble up to the surface. The total amount of carbon in permafrostassociated methane hydrates is much less than the carbon in permafrost soils. Global warming takes millennia to penetrate into the sediments beneath the ocean, which is why these hydrates are still responding to the last deglaciation. As a result, only a small fraction of the existing hydrates could be destabilised during the coming century. Even when methane is released from hydrates, most of it is expected to be consumed and oxidised into carbon dioxide in the ocean before reaching the atmosphere. The most complete modelling of these processes to date suggests a release to the atmosphere at a rate of less than 2% of current humaninduced methane emissions. Overall, thawing permafrost in the Arctic appears to be an important additional source of heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, more so than undersea hydrates. Climate and carbon cycle models are beginning to consider permafrost processes. While these models disagree on the exact amount of the heat-trapping gases that will be released into the atmosphere, they agree that the amount of such gases released from"}

Deliberate removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere could reverse some aspects of climate change. However, this will only happen if it results in a net reduction in the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, that is, if deliberate removals are larger than emissions. Some climate change trends, such as the increase in global surface temperature, would start to reverse within a few years. Other aspects of climate change would take decades or centuries to reverse, and some, such as sea level rise, would take centuries to millennia to change direction. The term negative carbon dioxide emissions refers to the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by deliberate human activities, in addition to the removals that occur naturally, and is often used as synonymous with carbon dioxide removal. Negative CO2 emissions can compensate for the release of CO2 into the atmosphere by human activities. They could be achieved by strengthening natural CO2 sequestration processes on land and/or in the ocean or by removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere. If CO2 removals are greater than human-caused CO2 emissions globally, emissions are said to be net negative. It should be noted that CO2 removal technologies are not yet ready or unable to achieve the scale of removal that would be required to compensate for current levels of emissions, and most have undesired side effects. In the absence of deliberate CO2 removal, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere results from a balance between human-caused CO2 release and the removal of CO2 by natural processes on land and in the ocean. If CO2 release exceeds removal by carbon sinks, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere would increase; if CO2 release equals removal, the atmospheric CO2 concentration would stabilise; and if CO2 removal exceeds release, the CO2 concentration would decline. This applies in the same way to net CO2 emissions that is, the sum of human-caused releases and deliberate removals. If the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere starts to go down, the Earths climate would respond to this change. Some parts of the climate system take time to react to a change in CO2 concentration, so a decline in atmospheric CO2 as a result of net negative emissions would not lead to immediate reversal of all climate change trends. Recent studies have shown that global surface temperature starts to decline within a few years following a decline in atmospheric CO2, although the decline would not be detectable for decades due to natural climate variability. Other consequences of humaninduced climate change such as reduction in permafrost area would take decades, and yet others such as warming, acidification and oxygen loss of the deep ocean would take centuries to reverse following a decline in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Sea level would continue to rise for many centuries to millennia, even if large deliberate CO2 removals were successfully implemented. A class of future scenarios that is receiving increasing attention, particularly in the context of ambitious climate goals such as the global warming limits of 1.5C or 2C included in the Paris Agreement, are socalled overshoot scenarios. In these scenarios, a slow rate of reductions in emissions in the near term is compensated by net negative CO2 emissions in the later part of this century, which results in a temporary breach or overshoot of a given warming level. Due to the delayed reaction of several climate system components, it follows that the temporary overshoot would result in additional climate changes compared to a scenario that reaches the goal without overshoot. These changes would take decades to many centuries to reverse, with the reversal taking longer for scenarios with larger overshoot. Removing more CO2 from the atmosphere than is emitted into it would indeed begin to reverse some aspects of climate change, but some changes would still continue in their current direction for decades to millennia. Approaches capable of large-scale removal of CO2 are still in the state of research and development or unproven at the scales of deployment necessary to achieve a net reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels. CO2 removal approaches, particularly those deployed on land, can have undesired side-effects on water, food production and biodiversity."}

There are several types of carbon budgets. Most often, the term refers to the total net amount of carbon dioxide that can still be emitted by human activities while limiting global warming to a specified level. This is referred to as the remaining carbon budget. Several choices and value judgments have to be made before it can be unambiguously estimated. When the remaining carbon budget is combined with all past CO2 emissions to date, a total carbon budget compatible with a specific global warming limit can also be defined. A third type of carbon budget is the historical carbon budget, which is a scientific way to describe all past and present sources and sinks of CO2. The term remaining carbon budget is used to describe the total net amount of CO2 that human activities can still release into the atmosphere while keeping global warming to a specified level, like 1.5C or 2C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. Emissions of CO2 from human activities are the main cause of global warming. A remaining carbon budget can be defined because of the specific way CO2 behaves in the Earth system. That is, global warming is roughly linearly proportional to the total net amount of CO2 emissions that are released into the atmosphere by human activities  also referred to as cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Other greenhouse gases behave differently and have to be accounted for separately. The concept of a remaining carbon budget implies that to stabilize global warming at any particular level, global emissions of CO2 need to be reduced to net zero levels at some point. Net zero CO2 emissions describes a situation in which all the anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are counterbalanced by deliberate anthropogenic removals so that on average no CO2 is added or removed from the atmosphere by human activities. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations in such a situation would gradually decline to a long-term stable level as excess CO2 in the atmosphere is taken up ocean and land sinks. The concept of a remaining carbon budget also means that if CO2 emissions reductions are delayed, deeper and faster reductions are needed later to stay within the same budget. If the remaining carbon budget is exceeded, this will result in either higher global warming or a need to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere to reduce global temperatures back down to the desired level. Estimating the size of remaining carbon budgets depends on a set of choices. These choices include the global warming level that is chosen as a limit, the probability with which we want to ensure that warming is held below that limit, and how successful we are in limiting emissions of other greenhouse gases that affect the climate, such as methane or nitrous oxide. These choices can be informed by science but ultimately represent subjective choices. Once they have been made, we can combine knowledge about how much our planet has warmed already, about the amount of warming per cumulative tonne of CO2, and about the amount of warming that is still expected once global net CO2 emissions are brought down to zero to estimate the remaining carbon budget for a given temperature goal. For example, to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels with either a one-in-two or two-in-three chance, the remaining carbon budgets amount to 500 and 400 billion tonnes of CO2, respectively, from 1 January 2020 onward. Currently, human activities are emitting around 40 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere in a single year. The remaining carbon budget depends on how much the world has already warmed to date. This past warming is caused by historical emissions, which are estimated by looking at the historical carbon budget  a scientific way to describe all past and present sources and sinks of CO2. It describes how the CO2 emissions from human activities have redistributed across the various CO2 reservoirs of the Earth system. These reservoirs are the ocean, the land vegetation, and the atmosphere. The share of CO2 that is not taken up by the ocean or the land, and that thus increases the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, causes global warming. The historical carbon budget tells us that of the about 2560 billion tonnes of CO2 that were released into the atmosphere by human activities between the years 1750 and 2019, about a quarter were absorbed by the ocean and about a third by the land vegetation. About 45% of these emissions remain in the atmosphere. Adding these historical CO2 emissions to estimates of remaining carbon budgets allows one to estimate the total carbon budget"}

In summary, determining a remaining carbon budget  that is, how much CO2 can be released into the atmosphere while stabilizing global temperature below a chosen level  is well understood but relies on a set of choices. What is clear, however, is that for limiting warming below 1.5C or 2C the remaining carbon budget from 2020 onwards is much smaller than the total CO2 emissions released to date. FAQ 5.4, Figure 1: Various types of carbon budgets. Historical cumulative CO2 emissions determine to a large degree how much the world has warmed to date, while the remaining carbon budget indicates how much CO2 could still be emitted while keeping warming below specific temperature thresholds. Several factors limit the precision with which the remaining carbon budget can be estimated, and estimates therefore need to specify the probability with which they aim at limiting warming to the intended target level."}

The anthropogenic CO2 emissions, including land use change, are partitioned via negative feedbacks between the ocean, the land and the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 that sets the changing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. This regulates most of the radiative forcing that creates the heat imbalance that drives the climate feedbacks to the ocean and land. Positive feedbacks result from processes in the ocean and on land. Positive feedbacks are influenced by both carbon-concentration and carbon-climate feedbacks simultaneously. Additional biosphere processes have been included but these have an as yet uncertain feedback impact. CO2 removal from the atmosphere into the ocean, land and geological reservoirs, necessary for negative emissions, has been included. Although this schematic is built around CO2, the dominant GHG, some of the same processes also influence the fluxes of CH4 and N2O and the strength of the positive feedbacks from the terrestrial and ocean systems."}

They include aerosols, which are also called particulate matter, and chemically reactive gases. Except for methane and some halogenated compounds whose lifetimes are about a decade or more, SLCFs abundances are highly spatially heterogeneous since they only persist in the atmosphere from a few hours to a couple of months. SLCFs are either radiatively active or influence the abundances of radiatively active compounds through chemistry, and their climate effect occurs predominantly in the first two decades after their emission or formation. They can have either a cooling or warming effect on climate, and they also affect precipitation and other climate variables. Methane and some halogenated compounds are included in climate treaties, unlike the other SLCFs that are nevertheless indirectly affected by climate change mitigation since many of them are often co-emitted with CO2 in combustion processes.

At the regional level, the evolution of CH4 emissions in climate mitigation scenarios is comparable to RCPs but there are significant differences for some regions with respect to high-emission scenarios. Especially, projection for East Asia differ significantly, the highest SSP3-7.0 is about half of the highest RCP by 2100 which is due to much lower projections of coal use in China driven largely by the last decade efforts to combat poor air quality. At the same time, the SSP scenarios without climate mitigation project faster growth in CH4 emissions in Africa, Middle East, and Latin America driven by developments in agriculture, oil and gas sectors, and, especially in Africa, waste management. There are significant differences in the assessment and feasibility of rapid CH4 mitigation. Hoglund-Isaksson et al. review most recent studies and assess feasibility of rapid widespread mitigation, concluding that significant reductions are attainable but feasibility of such reductions could be constrained in the short term due to locked capital. This might have implications for near term evolution assumed in, for example, SSP1-1.9 or SSP3-lowSLCF-lowCH4, where emissions drop very quickly due to fast decarbonization and reductions in agriculture. Such high reduction potential in agriculture has been also assumed in other studies but is questioned by Hoglund-Isaksson et al. who indicate that widespread implementation of policies bringing about institutional and behavioural changes would be important for transition towards very low CH4 emissions from livestock production."}

Thus, adjustments have been done to consider the differences between CH4 concentrations that would have been reached in a free to adjust simulation and a CH4-fixed simulation. As a consequence of this CH4 adjustment, a correction has to be applied to all the chemical species which are affected by CH4 modification, either through chemistry itself or through stratospheric H2O changes and cloud changes. Despite these corrections, some non-linear effects in the chemistry can not be fully captured and result in differences between the emission-based radiative forcing and the concentration- based radiative forcing.

These trends are neither a local phenomenon nor a measurement artefact. Multi-decadal variation in anthropogenic aerosol emissions are thought to be a major contributor, but multi-decadal variability in cloudiness may also have played a role. The downward and upward thermal radiation at the surface has increased in recent decades, in line with increased greenhouse gas concentrations and associated surface and atmospheric warming and moistening. Effective Radiative Forcing For carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons, there is now evidence to quantify the effect on ERF of tropospheric adjustments. The assessed ERF for a doubling of carbon dioxide compared to 1750 levels is larger than in AR5. Effective radiative forcings, introduced in AR5, have been estimated for a larger number of agents and shown to be more closely related to the temperature response than the stratospheric-temperature adjusted radiative forcing. For carbon dioxide, the adjustments include the physiological effects on vegetation. The total anthropogenic ERF over the industrial era was 2.72 W m-2. This estimate has increased by 0.43 W m-2 compared to AR5 estimates for 17502011. This increase includes a +0.34 W m-2 from increases in atmospheric concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases since 2011, a +0.15 W m-2 from upwards revisions of their radiative efficiencies and a +0.10 W m-2 from re-evaluation of the ozone and stratospheric water vapour ERF. The 0.59 W m-2 increase in ERF from greenhouse gases is partly offset by a better-constrained assessment of total aerosol ERF that is more strongly negative than in AR5, based on multiple lines of evidence. Changes in surface reflectance from land-use change, deposition of light-absorbing particles on ice and snow, and contrails and aviation-induced cirrus have also contributed to the total anthropogenic ERF over the industrial era, with 0.20 W m2, +0.08 W m2 and +0.06 W m-2, respectively. Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and their precursors contribute an ERF of 3.84 W m-2 over the industrial era. Most of this total ERF, 3.32 W m-2, comes from the well-mixed greenhouse gases, with changes in ozone and stratospheric water vapour contributing the remainder. The ERF of GHGs is composed of 2.16 W m-2 from carbon dioxide, 0.54 W m-2 from methane, 0.41 W m-2 from halogenated species, and 0.21 W m-2 from nitrous oxide. The ERF for ozone is 0.47 W m-2. The estimate of ERF for ozone has increased since AR5 due to revised estimates of precursor emissions and better accounting for effects of tropospheric ozone precursors in the stratosphere. The estimated ERF for methane has slightly increased due to a combination of increases from improved spectroscopic treatments being somewhat offset by accounting for adjustments. Aerosols contribute an ERF of 1.3 W m-2 over the industrial era. The ERF due to aerosolcloud interactions contributes most to the magnitude of the total aerosol ERF and is assessed to be 1.0 W m-2, with the remainder due to aerosolradiation interactions, assessed to be 0.3 W m-2. There has been an increase in the estimated magnitude but a reduction in the uncertainty of the total aerosol ERF relative to AR5, supported by a combination of increased process-understanding and progress in modelling and observational analyses. ERF estimates from these separate lines of evidence are now consistent with each other, in contrast to AR5, and support the assessment that it is virtually certain that the total aerosol ERF is negative. Compared to AR5, the assessed magnitude of ERFaci has increased, while the magnitude of ERFari has decreased. The total aerosol ERF over the period 17502019 is less certain than the headline statement assessment. It is also assessed to be smaller in magnitude at 1.1 W m-2, primarily due to recent emission changes."}

The same section also evaluates the surface temperature response to individual ERFs. 7.3.1 Methodologies and representation in models; overview of adjustments As introduced in Box 7.1, AR5 recommended ERF as a more useful measure of the climate effects of a physical driver than the stratospheric-temperature-adjusted radiative forcing adopted in earlier assessments. AR5 assessed that the ratios of surface temperature change to forcing resulting from perturbations of different forcing agents were more similar between species using ERF than SARF. ERF extended the SARF concept to account for not only adjustments to stratospheric temperatures, but also responses in the troposphere and effects on clouds and atmospheric circulation, referred to as adjustments. For more details see Box 7.1. Since circulation can be affected, these responses are not confined to the locality of the initial perturbation. This chapter defines adjustments as those changes caused by the forcing agent that are independent of changes in surface temperature, rather than defining a specific timescale. AR5 used the terminology rapid adjustment, but in this assessment the definition is based on the independence from surface temperature rather than the rapidity. The definition of ERF in Box 7.1 aims to have a clean separation between forcing and feedbacks. This means that changes in land or ocean surface temperature patterns (for instance as identified by Rugenstein et al.) are not included as adjustments. As in previous assessments ERFs can be attributed simply to changes in the forcing agent itself or attributed to components of emitted gases. Because ERFs can include chemical and biospheric responses to emitted gases, they can be attributed to precursor gases even if those gases do not have a direct radiative effect themselves. Similar chemical and biospheric responses to forcing agents can also be included in the ERF in addition to their direct effects. Instantaneous Radiative Forcing is defined here as the change in the net TOA radiative flux following a perturbation, excluding any adjustments. SARF is defined here as the change in the net radiative flux at TOA following a perturbation including the response to stratospheric temperature adjustments. These differ from AR5 where these quantities were defined at the tropopause. The net IRF values will be different using the TOA definition. The net SARF values will be the same as with the tropopause definition, but will have a different partitioning between the longwave and shortwave. Defining all quantities at the TOA enables consistency in breaking down the ERF into its component parts. The assessment of ERFs in AR5 was preliminary because ERFs were only available for a few forcing agents, so for many forcing agents the report made the assumption that ERF and SARF were equivalent. A body of work published since AR5 is discussed in this section that has computed ERFs across many more forcing agents and models, closely examined the methods of computation, quantified the processes involved in causing adjustments and examined how well ERFs predict the ultimate temperature response. This work is assessed to have led to a much-improved understanding and increased confidence in the quantification of radiative forcing across the Report. These same techniques allow for an evaluation of radiative forcing within Earth System Models as a key test of their ability to represent both historical and future temperature changes. The ERF for a particular forcing agent is the sum of the IRF and the contribution from the adjustments, so in principle this could be constructed bottom-up by calculating the IRF and adding in the adjustment contributions one-by-one or together. However, there is no simple way to derive the global tropospheric adjustment terms or adjustments related to circulation changes without using a comprehensive climate model. There have been two main modelling approaches used to approximate the ERF definition in Box 7.1. The first approach is to use the assumed linearity to regress the net change in the TOA radiation budget against change in global mean surface temperature following a step change in the forcing agent. The ERF is then derived from N when"}

Regression-based estimates of ERF depend on the temporal resolution of the data used. For the first few months of a simulation both surface temperature change and stratospheric temperature adjustment occur at the same time, leading to misattribution of the stratospheric temperature adjustment to the surface temperature feedback. Patterns of sea-surface temperature change also affect estimates of the forcing obtained by regression methods. At multidecadal timescales the curvature of the relationship between net TOA radiation and surface temperature can also lead to biases in the ERF estimated from the regression method. The second modelling approach to estimate ERF is to set the T term in Box 7.1 to zero. It is technically difficult to constrain land surface temperatures in ESMs, so most studies reduce the T term by prescribing the SSTs and sea-ice concentrations in a pair of fixed-SST simulations with and without the change in forcing agent. An approximation to ERF is then given by the difference in Nfsst between the simulations. The fSST method has less noise due to internal variability than the regression method. Nevertheless a 30-year fSST integration or 10  20-year regression ensemble needs to be conducted in order to reduce the 595% confidence range to 0.1 W m-2, thus neither method is practical for quantifying the ERF of agents with forcing magnitudes of order 0.1 W m-2 or smaller. The internal variability in the fSST method can be further constrained by nudging winds towards a prescribed climatology. This allows the determination of the ERF of forcing agents with smaller magnitudes but excludes adjustments associated with circulation responses. There are insufficient studies to assess whether these circulation adjustments are significant. Since the near-surface temperature change over land, Tland, is not constrained in the fSST method, this response needs to be removed for consistency with the Section 7.1 definition. These changes in the nearsurface temperature will also induce further responses in the tropospheric temperature and water vapour that should also be removed to conform with the physical definition of ERF. The radiative response to Tland can be estimated through radiative transfer modelling in which a kernel, k, representing the change in net TOA radiative flux per change in unit near-surface temperature change over land, is precomputed. Thus ERF  Ffsst k Tland. Since k is negative this means that Ffsst underestimates the ERF. For 2CO2 this term is around 0.2 W m-2. There have been estimates of the corrections due to tropospheric temperature and water vapour showing additional radiative responses of comparable magnitude to those directly from Tland. An alternative to computing the response terms directly is to use the feedback parameter, ,. This gives approximately double the correction compared to the kernel approach. The response to land surface temperature change varies with location and even for GSAT change k is not expected to be the same as. One study where land-surface temperatures are constrained in a model finds this constraint adds +1.0 W m-2 to Ffsst for 4CO2, thus confirming the need for a correction in calculations where this constraint is not applied. For this assessment the correction is conservatively based only on the direct radiative response kernel to Tland as this has a strong theoretical basis to support it. While there is currently insufficient corroborating evidence to recommend including tropospheric temperature and water vapour corrections in this assessment, it is noted that the science is progressing rapidly on this topic. TOA radiative flux changes due to the individual adjustments can be calculated by perturbing the meteorological fields in a climate models radiative transfer scheme or by using precomputed radiative kernels of sensitivities of the TOA radiation fluxes to changes in these fields. The radiative kernel approach is easier to implement through post-processing of output from multiple ESMs, whereas it is recognized that the partial radiation perturbation approach gives a more accurate estimate of the adjustments within the setup of a single model and its own radiative transfer code. There is little difference between using a radiative kernel from the same or a different model when calculating the adjustment terms, except for stratospheric temperature adjustments where it is important to have sufficient vertical resolution in the stratosphere in the model used to derive the kernel."}

Adjustments computed from radiative kernels are shown for seven different climate drivers in Figure 7.4. Table 7.2 shows the estimates of SARF, Ffsst and ERF for 2CO2 from the nine climate models analysed in Smith et al.. The SARF shows a smaller spread over previous studies and most estimates are within 10% of the multi-model mean and the assessment of 2CO2 SARF in Section 7.3.2. It is not possible from these studies to determine how much of this reduction in spread is due to convergence in the model radiation schemes or the meteorological conditions of the model base states; nevertheless the level of agreement in this and earlier intercomparisons gives medium confidence in ESMs ability to represent radiative forcing from CO2. The 4CO2 CMIP6 fSST experiments in Table 7.2 include ESMs with varying levels of complexity in aerosols and reactive gas chemistry. The CMIP6 experimental setup allows for further climate effects of CO2 depending on model complexity. The chemical effects are adjustments to CO2 but are not separable from the SARF in the diagnosis in Table 7.2. In these particular models, this leads to higher SARF than when only CO2 varies, however there are insufficient studies to make a formal assessment of composition adjustments to CO2."}

ERF can be computed from prescribed SST and sea-ice experiments after removing the TOA energy budget change associated with the land surface temperature response. In this assessment this is removed using a kernel accounting only for the direct radiative effect of the land surface temperature response. To compare these results with sophisticated high spectral resolution radiative transfer models the individual tropospheric adjustment terms can be removed to leave the SARF. SARFs for 2CO2 calculated by ESMs from this method agree within 10% with the more sophisticated models. The new studies highlighted above suggest that physical feedback parameters computed within this framework have less variation across forcing agents. There is high confidence that an  based on ERF as defined here varies by less, than  based on SARF. For geographically localised forcing agents there are fewer studies and less agreement between them, resulting in low confidence that ERF is a suitable estimator of the resulting global mean near-surface temperature response. 7.3.2 Greenhouse Gases High spectral resolution radiative transfer models provide the most accurate calculations of radiative perturbations due to greenhouse gases with errors in the IRF of less than 1%. They can calculate IRFs with no adjustments, or SARFs by accounting for the adjustment of stratospheric temperatures using a fixed dynamical heating. It is not possible with offline radiation models to account for other adjustments. The high resolution model calculations of SARF for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have been updated since AR5, which were based on Myhre et al.. The new calculations include the shortwave forcing from methane and updates to the water vapour continuum and account for the absorption band overlaps between carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. The associated simplified expressions, from a re-fitting of the Etminan et al. results by Meinshausen et al., are given in Supplementary Table 7.SM.1. The shortwave contribution to the IRF of methane has been confirmed independently. Since they incorporate known missing effects we assess the new calculations as being a more appropriate representation than Myhre et al.. As described in Section 7.3.1, ERFs can be estimated using ESMs, however the radiation schemes in climate models are approximations to high spectral resolution radiative transfer models with variations and biases in results between the schemes. Hence ESMs alone are not sufficient to establish ERF best estimates for the well-mixed GHGs. This assessment therefore estimates ERFs from a combined approach that uses the SARF from radiative transfer models and adds the tropospheric adjustments derived from EMSs. In AR5, the main information used to assess components of ERFs beyond SARF was from Vial et al. who found a near-zero non-stratospheric adjustment in 4CO2 CMIP5 model experiments, with an uncertainty of 10% of the total CO2 ERF. No calculations were available for other WMGHGs, so ERF was therefore assessed to be approximately equal to SARF for all WMGHGs. The effect of WMGHGs in ESMs can extend beyond their direct radiative effects to include effects on ozone and aerosol chemistry and natural emissions of ozone and aerosol precursors, and in the case of CO2 to vegetation cover through physiological effects. In some cases these can have significant effects on the overall radiative budget changes from perturbing WMGHGs within ESMs. These composition adjustments are further discussed in Chapter 6. 7.3.2.1 Carbon Dioxide The SARF for CO2 has been slightly revised due to updates to spectroscopic data and inclusion of the absorption band overlaps between N2O and CO2.

This increases the SARF due to doubling CO2 slightly from 3.71 W m-2 in AR5 to 3.75 W m-2. Tropospheric responses to CO2 in fSST experiments have been found to lead to an approximate balance in their radiative effects between an increased radiative forcing due to water vapour, cloud and surface albedo adjustments and a decrease due to increased tropospheric temperature and land surface temperature response. The Ffsst includes any effects represented within the ESMs on tropospheric adjustments due to changes in evapotranspiration or leaf area from the CO2-physiological effects. The effect on surface temperature is consistent with the expected physiological responses and needs to be removed for consistency with the ERF definition. The split between surface and tropospheric temperature responses was not reported in Vial et al. or Zhang and Huang but the total of surface and tropospheric temperature response agrees with Smith et al. giving medium confidence in this decomposition. Doutriaux-Boucher et al. and Andrews et al. find a 13% and 10% increase respectively in ERF due to the physiological responses to CO2. The physiological adjustments are therefore assessed to make a substantial contribution to the overall tropospheric adjustment for CO2, but there is insufficient evidence to provide a quantification of the split between physiological and thermodynamic adjustments. These forcing adjustments due to the effects of CO2 on plant physiology differ from the biogeophysical feedbacks due to the effects of temperature changes on vegetation discussed in Section 7.4.2.5. The adjustment is assumed to scale with the SARF in the absence of evidence for non-linearity. The tropospheric adjustment is assessed from Table 7.3 to be +5% of the SARF with an uncertainty of 5%, which is added to the Meinshausen et al. formula for SARF. Due to the agreement between the studies and the understanding of the physical mechanisms there is medium confidence in the mechanisms underpinning the tropospheric adjustment, but low confidence in its magnitude.

Adjustments have been calculated in nine climate models by Smith et al.. Since CH4 is found to absorb in the shortwave near infrared, only adjustments from those models including this absorption are taken into account. For these models the adjustments act to reduce the ERF because the shortwave absorption leads to tropospheric heating and reductions in upper tropospheric cloud amounts. The adjustment is 14%  15% which counteracts much of the increase in SARF identified by Etminan et al.. Modak et al. also found negative forcing adjustments from a methane perturbation including shortwave absorption in the NCAR CAM5 model, in agreement with the above assessment. The uncertainty in the shortwave component leads to a higher radiative modelling uncertainty than for CO2. When combined with the uncertainty in the adjustment, this gives an overall uncertainty of  20%. There is high confidence in the spectroscopic revision but only medium confidence in the adjustment modification. CH4 concentrations have increased from 729 ppb in 1750 to 1866 ppb in 2019. The historical ERF estimate from AR5 of 0.48  0.10 W m-2 is revised to 0.54  0.11 W m-2 in this assessment from a combination of spectroscopic radiative efficiency revisions, adjustments and the 63 ppb rise in atmospheric CH4 concentrations between 2011 and 2019. As the adjustments are assessed to be small, there is high confidence in the overall assessment of ERF from methane. Increased methane leads to tropospheric ozone production and increased stratospheric water vapour, so that an attribution of forcing to methane emissions gives a larger effect than that directly from the methane concentration itself.

This value is therefore taken as the assessed adjustment, but with low confidence. The radiative modelling uncertainty is  10%, giving an overall uncertainty of  16%. Nitrous oxide concentrations have increased from 270 ppb in 1750 to 332 ppb in 2019. The historical ERF estimate from N2O is revised upwards from 0.17  0.06 W m-2 in AR5 to 0.21  0.03 W m-2 in this assessment, of which 0.02 W m-2 is due to the 7 ppb increase in concentrations, and 0.02 W m-2 to the tropospheric adjustment. As the adjustments are assessed to be small there remains high confidence in the overall assessment. Increased nitrous oxide leads to ozone depletion in the upper stratosphere which will make a positive contribution to the direct ERF here when considering emission-based estimates of ERF. 7.3.2.4 Halogenated species The stratospheric-temperature adjusted radiative efficiencies for halogenated compounds are reviewed extensively in Hodnebrog et al., an update to those used in AR5. Many halogenated compounds have lifetimes short enough that they can be considered short-lived climate forcers. As such, they are not completely well-mixed and their vertical distributions are taken into account when determining their radiative efficiencies. The WMO updated the lifetimes of many halogenated compounds and these were used in Hodnebrog et al.. The tropospheric adjustments to chlorofluorocarbons, specifically CFC-11 and CFC-12, have been quantified as 13%  10% and 12%  14% of the SARF respectively. The assessed adjustment to CFCs is therefore 12 %  13% with low confidence due to the lack of corroborating studies. There have been no calculations for other halogenated species so for these the tropospheric adjustments are therefore assumed to be 0  13% with low confidence. The radiative modelling uncertainties are 14% and 24% for compounds with lifetimes greater than and less than 5 years respectively. The overall uncertainty in the ERFs of halogenated compounds is therefore assessed to be 19% and 26% depending on the lifetime. The ERF from CFCs is slowly decreasing, but this is compensated for by the increased forcing from the replacement species. The ERF from HFCs has increased by 0.028  0.05 W m-2. Thus, the concentration changes mean that the total ERF from halogenated compounds has increased since AR5 from 0.360  0.036 W m-2 to 0.408  0.078 W m-2. Of this 0.034 W m-2 is due to increased radiative efficiencies and tropospheric adjustments, and 0.014 W m-2 due to increases in concentrations. As the adjustments are assessed to be small there remains high confidence in the overall assessment. Halogenated compounds containing chlorine and bromine lead to ozone depletion in the stratosphere which will reduce the associated ERF. Chapter 6, Section 6.4 and Figure 6.12 assess the ERF contributions due to the chemical effects of reactive gases. 7.3.2.5 Ozone Estimates of the pre-industrial to present-day tropospheric ozone radiative forcing are based entirely on models.

Further studies suggest that changes in circulation due to decreases in stratospheric ozone affect Southern Hemisphere clouds and the atmospheric levels of sea salt aerosol that would contribute additional adjustments, possibly of comparable magnitude to the SARF from stratospheric ozone depletion. ESM responses to changes in ozone depleting substances in CMIP6 show a much more negative ERF than would be expected from offline calculations of SARF again suggesting a negative contribution from adjustments. However there is insufficient evidence available to quantify this effect. Without sufficient information to assess whether the ERFs differ from SARF, this assessment relies on offline radiative transfer calculations of SARF for both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. Checa-Garcia et al. found SARF of 0.30 W m-2 for changes in ozone. These were based on precursor emissions and ODS concentrations from the Coupled Chemistry Model Initiative project. Skeie et al. calculated an ozone SARF of 0.41  0.12 W m-2 using CMIP6 precursor emissions and ODS concentrations. The ozone precursor emissions are higher in CMIP6 than in CCMI which explains much of the increase compared to Checa-Garcia et al.. Previous assessments have split the ozone forcing into tropospheric and stratospheric components. This does not correspond to the division between ozone production and ozone depletion and is sensitive to the choice of tropopause. The contributions to total SARF in CMIP6 are 0.39  0.07 and 0.02  0.07 W m-2 for troposphere and stratosphere respectively. This small positive stratospheric ozone SARF is due to contributions from ozone precursors to lower stratospheric ozone and some of the CMIP6 models showing ozone depletion in the upper stratosphere, where depletion contributes a positive radiative forcing. As there is insufficient evidence to quantify adjustments, for total ozone the assessed central estimate for ERF is assumed to be equal to SARF and follows Skeie et al. since that study uses the most recent emission data. The dataset is extended over the entire historical period following Skeie et al. with a SARF for 1750 to 1850 of 0.03 W m-2 and for 2010 to 2018 of 0.03 W m-2, to give 0.47 W m-2 for 1750 to 2019. This maintains the 50% uncertainty from AR5 which is largely due to the uncertainty in pre-industrial emissions. There also high confidence that this range includes uncertainty due to the adjustments. The CMIP6 SARF is more positive than the AR5 value of 0.31 W m-2 for the period 1850 to 2011 which was based on the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Intercomparison Project. The assessment is sensitive to the assumptions on precursor emissions used to drive the models, which are larger in CMIP6 than ACCMIP. In summary, although there is insufficient evidence to quantify adjustments, there is high confidence in the assessed range of ERF for ozone changes over the 1750 to 2019 period, giving an assessed ERF of 0.47 W m-2. 7.3.2.6 Stratospheric water vapour This section considers direct anthropogenic effects on stratospheric water vapour by oxidation of methane. Since AR5 the SARF from methane-induced stratospheric water vapour changes has been calculated in two models, both corresponding to 0.09 W m-2. This is marginally larger than the AR5 assessed value of 0.070.05 W m-2. However, OConnor et al. found the ERF to be approximately zero due to a negative cloud adjustment. Wang and Huang quantified the adjustment"}

They found that the ERF was less than 50% of the SARF due to high cloud decrease and upper tropospheric warming. The assessed ERF is therefore 0.050.05 W m-2 with a lower limit reduced to zero and the central value and upper limit reduced to allow for adjustment terms. This still encompasses the two recent SARF studies. There is medium confidence in the SARF from agreement with the recent studies and AR5. There is low confidence in the adjustment terms. Stratospheric water vapour may also change as an adjustment to species that warm or cool the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere region, in which case it should be included as part of the ERF for that compound. Changes in GSAT are also associated with changes in stratospheric water vapour as part of the water vapour climate feedback. 7.3.2.7 Synthesis The GHGs ERF over 1750 to 2019 is assessed to be 3.32  0.29 W m-2. It has increased by 0.49 W m-2 compared to AR5. Most of this has been due to an increase in CO2 concentration since 2011, with concentration increases in CH4, N2O and halogenated compounds adding 0.02, 0.02 and 0.01 W m-2 respectively. Changes in the radiative efficiencies of CO2, CH4, N2O and halogenated compounds have increased the ERF by an additional 0.15 W m-2 compared to the AR5 values. Note that the ERFs in this section do not include chemical effects of GHGs on production or destruction of ozone or aerosol formation. The ERF for ozone is considerably increased compared to AR5 due to an increase in the assumed ozone precursor emissions in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5, and better accounting for the effects of both ozone precursors and ODSs in the stratosphere. The ERF for stratospheric water vapour is slightly reduced. The combined ERF from ozone and stratospheric water vapour has increased since AR5 by 0.10  0.50 W m-2, although the uncertainty ranges still include the AR5 values.

This is particularly true for sulphate and carbonaceous aerosols. This has in turn led to changes in the scattering and absorption of incoming solar radiation, and also affected cloud microand macro-physics and thus cloud radiative properties. Aerosol changes are heterogeneous in both space and time and have impacted not just Earths radiative energy budget but also air quality. Here, the assessment is focused exclusively on the global mean effects of aerosols on Earths energy budget, while regional changes and changes associated with individual aerosol compounds are assessed in Chapter 6, Sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2. Consistent with the terminology introduced in Box 7.1, the ERF due to changes from direct aerosol-radiation interactions is equal to the sum of the instantaneous TOA radiation change and the subsequent adjustments. Likewise, the ERF following interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and clouds can be divided into an instantaneous forcing component due to changes in cloud droplet number concentrations and sizes, and the subsequent adjustments of cloud water content or extent. While these changes are thought to be induced primarily by changes in the abundance of cloud condensation nuclei, a change in the number of ice nucleating particles in the atmosphere may also have occurred, and thereby contributed to ERFaci by affecting properties of mixed-phase and cirrus clouds. In the following, an assessment of IRFari and ERFari focusing on observation-based as well as model-based evidence is presented. The same lines of evidence are presented for IRFaci and ERFaci in Section 7.3.3.2. These lines of evidence are then compared with TOA energy budget constraints on the total aerosol ERF before an overall assessment of the total aerosol ERF is given in Section 7.3.3.4. For the model-based evidence, all estimates are generally valid for 2014 relative to 1750, while for observationbased evidence the assessed studies use slightly different end points, but they all generally fall within a decade."}

Combined with new insights into adjustments to aerosol forcing, this progress has informed new observationand model-based estimates of ERFari and associated uncertainties. 7.3.3.1.1 Observation-based lines of evidence Estimating IRFari requires an estimate of industrial-era changes in Aerosol Optical Depth and absorption AOD, which are often taken from global aerosol model simulations. Since AR5, updates to methods of estimating IRFari based on aerosol remote sensing or data-assimilated reanalyses of atmospheric composition have been published. Ma et al. applied the method of Quaas et al. to updated broadband radiative flux measurements from CERES, MODIS-retrieved AODs, and modelled anthropogenic aerosol fractions to find a clear-sky IRFari of 0.6 W m2. This would translate into an all-sky estimate of about 0.3 W m2 based on the clear-to-all-sky ratio implied by Kinne. Remy et al. applied the methods of Bellouin et al. to the reanalysis by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, which assimilates MODIS total AOD. Their estimate of IRFari varies between 0.5 W m-2 and 0.6 W m2 over the period 20032018, and they attribute those relatively small variations to variability in biomass-burning activity. Kinne provided updated monthly total AOD and absorption AOD climatologies, obtained by blending multi-model averages with ground-based sun-photometer retrievals, to find a best estimate of IRFari of 0.4 W m2. The updated IRFari estimates above are all scattered around the midpoint of the IRFari range of 0.35  0.5 W m2 assessed by AR5. The more negative estimate of Remy et al. is due to neglecting a small positive contribution from absorbing aerosols above clouds and obtaining a larger anthropogenic fraction than Kinne. Remy et al. also did not update their assumptions on black carbon anthropogenic fraction and its contribution to absorption to reflect recent downward revisions. Kinne made those revisions, so more weight is given to that study to assess the central estimate of satellite-based IRFari to be only slightly stronger than reported in AR5 at 0.4 W m-2. While uncertainties in the anthropogenic fraction of total AOD remain, improved knowledge of anthropogenic absorption results in a slightly narrower very likely range here than in AR5. The assessed best estimate and very likely IRFari range from observation-based evidence is therefore 0.4  0.4 W m-2 , but with medium confidence due to the limited number of studies available. 7.3.3.1.2 Model-based lines of evidence While observation-based evidence can be used to estimate IRFari, global climate models are needed to calculate the associated adjustments and the resulting ERFari, using the methods described in Section 7.3.1. A range of developments since AR5 affect model-based estimates of IRFari. Global emissions of most major aerosol compounds and their precursors are found to be higher in the current inventories, and with increasing trends. Emissions of the sulphate precursor SO2 are a notable exception; they are similar to those used in AR5 and approximately time-constant in recent decades. Myhre et al. showed, in a multi-model experiment, that the net result of these revised emissions is an IRFari trend that is relatively flat in recent years, a finding confirmed by a single-model study by Paulot et al.. In AR5, the assessment of the black carbon contribution to IRFari was markedly strengthened in confidence by the review by Bond et al., where a key finding was a perceived model underestimate of atmospheric absorption when compared to Aeronet observations. This assessment has since been revised considering new knowledge on the effect of the temporal resolution of emission inventories, the representativeness of Aeronet sites, issues with comparing absorption retrieval to models, and the ageing, lifetime and average optical parameters of BC. Consistent with these updates, Lund et al. estimated the net IRFari in 2014 to be 0.17 W m-2, using CEDS emissions as input to a chemical transport model. They attributed the weaker estimate relative to AR5 to stronger absorption by organic aerosol,"}

Broadly consistent with Lund et al., another single-model study by Petersik et al. estimated an IRFari of 0.19 W m-2. Another single-model study by Lurton et al. reported a more negative estimate at 0.38 W m-2, but is given less weight here because the model lacked interactive aerosols and instead used prescribed climatological aerosol concentrations. The above estimates support a less negative central estimate and a slightly narrower range compared to those reported for IRFari from ESMs in AR5 of 0.35 W m-2. The assessed central estimate and very likely IRFari range from model-based evidence alone is therefore 0.2  0.2 W m-2 for 2014 relative to 1750, with medium confidence due to the limited number of studies available. Revisions due to stronger organic aerosol absorption, further developed BC parameterizations and somewhat reduced sulphate emissions in recent years. Since AR5 considerable progress has been made in the understanding of adjustments in response to a wide range of climate forcings, as discussed in Section 7.3.1. The adjustments in ERFari are principally caused by cloud changes, but also by lapse rate and atmospheric water vapour changes, all mainly associated with absorbing aerosols like BC. Stjern et al. found that for BC, about 30% of the IRFari is offset by adjustments of clouds and lapse rate, by analysing simulations by five Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project models. Smith et al. considered more models participating in PDRMIP and suggested that about half the IRFari was offset by adjustments for BC, a finding generally supported by single-model studies. Thornhill et al. also reported a negative adjustment for BC based on AerChemMIP but found it to be somewhat smaller in magnitude than those reported in Smith et al. and Stjern et al.. In contrast, Allen et al. found a positive adjustment for BC and suggested that most models simulate negative adjustment for BC because of a misrepresentation of aerosol atmospheric heating profiles. Zelinka et al. used the Approximate Partial Radiation Perturbation technique to quantify the ERFari in 2000 relative to 1860 in nine CMIP5 models; they estimated the ERFari to be 0.27  0.35 W m-2. However, it should be noted that in Zelinka et al. adjustments of clouds caused by absorbing aerosols through changes in the thermal structure of the atmosphere are not included in ERFari but in ERFaci. The corresponding estimate emerging from the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project is 0.25  0.40 W m-2, which is generally supported by singlemodel studies published post-AR5. A 5% inflation is applied to the CMIP5 and CMIP6 fixed-SST derived estimates of ERFari from Zelinka et al. and to account for land surface cooling. Based on the above, ERFari from model-based evidence is assessed to be 38 0.25  0.25 W m-2. 7.3.3.1.3 Overall assessment of IRFari and ERFari The observation-based assessment of IRFari of 0.4  0.4 W m-2 and the corresponding model-based assessment of 0.2  0.2 W m-2 can be compared to the range of 0.45 W m-2 to 0.05 W m-2 that emerged from a comprehensive review in which an observation-based estimate of anthropogenic AOD was combined with model-derived ranges for all relevant aerosol radiative properties. Based on the above, IRFari is assessed to be 0.25  0.2 W m-2. ERFari from model-based evidence is 0.25  0.25 W m-2, which suggests a small negative adjustment relative to the model-based IRFari estimate, consistent with the literature discussed in 7.3.3.1.2. Adding this small adjustment to our assessed IRFari estimate of 0.25 W m-2, and accounting for additional uncertainty in the adjustments, ERFari is assessed to 0.3  0.3. This assessment is consistent with the 5% to 95 % confidence range for ERFari in Bellouin et al. of 0.71 to 0.14 W m-2, and notably implies that it is very likely that ERFari is negative. Differences relative to Bellouin et al. reflect the range of estimates in Table 7.6 and the fact that a more negative ERFari than -0.6 W m-2 would require"}

These findings have been explained by enhanced evaporation of the smaller droplets in the aerosol-enriched environments, and resultant enhanced mixing with ambient air, leading to cloud dispersal. A small subset of aerosols can also serve as ice nucleating particles that initiate the ice phase in supercooled water clouds, and thereby alter cloud radiative properties and/or lifetimes. However, the ability of anthropogenic aerosols to serve as INPs in mixed-phase clouds has been found to be negligible in recent laboratory studies (e.g., Vergara-Temprado et al.). No assessment of the contribution to ERFaci from cloud phase changes induced by anthropogenic INPs will therefore be presented. In ice clouds, INPs can initiate ice crystal formation at relative humidity much lower than that required for droplets to freeze spontaneously. Anthropogenic INPs can thereby influence ice crystal numbers and thus cirrus cloud radiative properties. At cirrus temperatures, certain types of BC have in fact been demonstrated to act as INPs in laboratory studies, suggesting a non-negligible anthropogenic contribution to INPs in cirrus clouds. Furthermore, anthropogenic changes to drop number also alter the number of droplets available for spontaneous freezing, thus representing a second pathway through which anthropogenic emissions could affect cirrus clouds. 7.3.3.2.1 Observation-based evidence Since AR5, the analysis of observations to investigate aerosol-cloud interactions has progressed along several axes: The framework of forcing and adjustments introduced rigorously in AR5 has helped better categorize studies; the literature assessing statistical relationships between aerosoland cloud in satellite retrievals has grown, and retrieval uncertainties are better characterized; advances have been made to infer causality in aerosol-cloud relationships.

In AR5 the statistical relationship between cloud microphysical properties and aerosol index was used to make inferences about IRFaci were assessed alongside other studies which related cloud quantities to AOD. However, it is now well-documented that the latter approach leads to low estimates of IRFaci since AOD is a poor proxy for cloud-base CCN. Gryspeerdt et al. demonstrated that the statistical relationship between droplet concentration and AOD leads to an inferred IRFaci that is underestimated by at least 30%, while the use of AI leads to estimates of IRFaci to within 20%, if the anthropogenic perturbation of AI is known. Further, studies assessed in AR5 mostly investigated linear relationships between cloud droplet concentration and aerosol. Since in most cases the relationships are not linear, this leads to a bias. Several studies did not relate cloud droplet concentration, but cloud droplet effective radius to the aerosol. This is problematic since then, in order to infer IRFaci, stratification by cloud LWP is required. Where LWP positively co-varies with aerosol retrievals, IRFaci inferred from such relationships is biased towards low values. Also, it is increasingly evident that different cloud regimes show different sensitivities to aerosols. Averaging statistics over regimes thus bias the inferred IRFaci. AR5 concluded that IRFaci estimates tied to satellite studies generally show weak IRFaci, but when correcting for the biases discussed above, this is no longer the case. Since AR5, several studies assessed the global IRFaci from satellite observations using different methods. All studies relied on statistical relationships between aerosoland cloud quantities to infer sensitivities. Four studies inferred IRFaci by estimating the anthropogenic perturbation of Nd. For this, Bellouin et al. and Remy et al. made use of regional-seasonal regressions between satellitederived Nd and AOD following Quaas et al., while Gryspeerdt et al. used AI instead of AOD in the regression to infer IRFaci. McCoy et al. instead used the sulphate specific mass derived in the MERRA aerosol reanalysis that assimilated MODIS AOD. All approaches have in common the need to identify the anthropogenic perturbation of the aerosol to assess IRFaci. Gryspeerdt et al. and Remy et al. used the same approach as Bellouin et al., while McCoy et al. used an anthropogenic fraction from the AEROCOM multi-model ensemble. Chen et al., Christensen et al. and Christensen et al. derived the combination of IRFaci and the LWP adjustment to IRFaci. They relate AI and cloud albedo statistically and use the anthropogenic aerosol fraction from Bellouin et al.. This was further refined by Hasekamp et al. who used additional polarimetric satellite information over ocean to obtain a better proxy for CCN. They derived an IRFaci of 1.14 W m-2. The variant by Christensen et al. is an update compared to the Chen et al. and Christensen et al. studies in that it better accounts for ancillary influences on the aerosol retrievals such as aerosol swelling and 3D radiative effects. McCoy et al. used the satellite-observed hemispheric difference in Nd as an emergent constraint on IRFaci as simulated by GCMs to obtain a range of 1.2 to 0.6 W m-2. Diamond et al. analysed the difference in clouds affected by ship emissions with unperturbed clouds and based on this inferred a global IRFaci of 0.69 W m-2. Summarising the above findings related to statistical relationships and causal aerosol effects on cloud properties, there is high confidence that anthropogenic aerosols lead to an increase in cloud droplet concentrations. Taking the average across the studies providing IRFaci estimates discussed above and considering the general agreement among estimates, IRFaci is assessed to be 0.7  0.5 W m-2."}

Since AR5, however, it has been documented that factors independent of causal aerosol-cloud interactions heavily influence such statistical relationships. These include the swelling of aerosols in the high relative humidity in the vicinity of clouds and the contamination of aerosol retrievals next to clouds by cloud remnants and cloud-side scattering. Stratifying relationships by possible influencing factors such as relative humidity does not yield satisfying results since observations of the relevant quantities are not available at the resolution and quality required. Another approach to tackle this problem was to assess the relationship of cloud fraction with droplet concentration. The relationship between satelliteretrieved cloud fraction and Nd was found to be positive, implying an overall adjustment that leads to a more negative ERFaci. However, since retrieved Nd is biased low for broken clouds this result has been called into question. Zhu et al. proposed to circumvent this problem by considering Nd of only continuous thick cloud covers, on the basis of which Rosenfeld et al. still obtained a positive cloud fraction  Nd relationship. The relationship between LWP and cloud droplet number is debated. Most recent studies find negative statistical relationships, while Rosenfeld et al. obtained a modest positive relationship. To increase confidence that observed relationships between aerosol emissions and cloud adjustments are causal, known emissions of aerosols and aerosol precursor gases into otherwise pristine conditions have been exploited. Ship exhaust is one such source. Goren and Rosenfeld suggested that both LWP and Cf increase in response to ship emissions, contributing approximately 75% to the total ERFaci in mid-latitude stratocumulus. Christensen and Stephens found that such strong adjustments occur for open-cell stratocumulus regimes, while adjustments are comparatively small in closed-cell regimes. Volcanic emissions have been identified as another important source of information. From satellite observations, Yuan et al. documented substantially larger Cf, higher cloud tops, reduced precipitation likelihood, and increased albedo in cumulus clouds in the plume of the Kilauea volcano. Ebmeier et al. confirmed the increased LWP and albedo for other volcanoes. In contrast, for the large Holuhraun eruption, Malavelle et al. did not find any large-scale change in LWP in satellite observations. However, when accounting for meteorological conditions, McCoy et al. concluded that for cyclonic conditions, the extra Holuhraun aerosol did enhance LWP. Toll et al. examined a large sample of volcanoes and found a distinct albedo effect, but only modest LWP changes on average. Gryspeerdt et al. demonstrated that the negative LWP  Nd relationship becomes very small when conditioned on a volcanic eruption, and therefore concluded that LWP adjustments are small in most regions. Similarly, Toll et al. studied clouds downwind of various anthropogenic aerosol sources using satellite observations and inferred an IRFaci of 0.52 W m-2 that was partly offset by 29% due to aerosol-induced LWP decreases. Apart from adjustments involving LWP and Cf, several studies have also documented a negative relationship between cloud-top temperature and AOD/AI in satellite observations. Wilcox et al. proposed that this could be explained by BC absorption reducing boundary layer turbulence, which in turn could lead to taller clouds. However, it has been demonstrated that the satellite-derived relationships are affected by spurious co-variation, and it therefore remains unclear whether a systematic causal effect exists. Identifying relationships between INP concentrations and cloud properties from satellites is intractable because the INPs generally represent a very small subset of the overall aerosol population at any given time or location. For ice clouds, only few satellite studies have investigated responses to aerosol perturbations so far. Gryspeerdt et al. find a positive relationship between aerosol and ice crystal number for cold cirrus under strong dynamical forcing, which could be explained by an overall larger number of solution droplets available for homogeneous freezing in polluted regions. Zhao et al. conclude that the sign of the ice crystal size  aerosol relationship depends on humidity. While these studies support modelling results finding that ice clouds do respond to anthropogenic aerosols, no quantitative conclusions about IRFaci or ERFaci for ice clouds can be drawn based on satellite observations."}

Chen et al. and Christensen et al. used the relationship between cloud fraction and AI to infer the cloud fraction adjustment. Gryspeerdt et al. used a similar approach but tried to account for non-causal aerosol  cloud fraction correlations by using Nd as a mediating factor. These three studies together suggest a global Cf adjustment that augments ERFaci relative to IRFaci by 0.5  0.4 W m2. For global estimates of the LWP adjustment, evidence is even scarcer. Gryspeerdt et al. derived an estimate of the LWP adjustment using a method similar to Gryspeerdt et al.. They estimated that the LWP adjustment offsets 0 to 60% of the IRFaci. Supporting an offsetting LWP adjustment, Toll et al. estimated a moderate LWP adjustment of 29%. The adjustment due to LWP is assessed to be small, with a central estimate and very likely range of 0.2  0.2 W m2 , but with low confidence due to the limited number of studies available. Combining IRFaci and the associated adjustments in Cf and LWP, considering only liquid-water clouds and evidence from satellite observations alone, the central estimate and very likely range for ERFaci is assessed to be 1.0  0.7 W m2. The confidence level and wider range for ERFaci compared to IRFaci reflect the relatively large uncertainties that remain in the adjustment contribution to ERFaci. 7.3.3.2.2 Model-based evidence As in AR5, the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in ESMs remains a challenge, due to the limited representation of important sub-gridscale processes, from the emissions of aerosols and their precursors to precipitation formation. ESMs that simulate ERFaci typically include aerosol-cloud interactions in liquid stratiform clouds only, while very few include aerosol interactions with mixed-phase-, convective-, and ice clouds. Adding to the spread in model-derived estimates of ERFaci is the fact that model configurations and assumptions vary across studies, for example when it comes to the treatment of oxidants, which influence aerosol formation, and their changes through time. In AR5, ERFaci was assessed as the residual of the total aerosol ERF and ERFari, as the total aerosol ERF was easier to calculate based on available model simulations. The central estimates of total aerosol ERF and ERFari in AR5 were 0.9 W m-2 and 0.45 W m-2, respectively, yielding an ERFaci estimate of 0.45 W m-2. This value is much less negative than the bottom-up estimate of ERFaci from ESMs presented in AR5 and efforts have been made since to reconcile this difference. Zelinka et al. estimated ERFaci to be 0.96  0.55 W m-2 based on nine CMIP5 models. The corresponding ERFaci estimate based on 17 RFMIP models from CMIP6 is slightly less negative at 0.86  0.57 W m-2. Other postAR5 estimates of ERFaci based on single model studies are either in agreement with or slightly larger in magnitude than the CMIP6 estimate. The adjustment contribution to the CMIP6 ensemble mean ERFaci is 0.20 W m-2, though with considerable differences between the models. Generally, this adjustment in ESMs arises mainly from LWP changes, while satellite observations suggest that cloud cover adjustments dominate and that aerosol effects on LWP are over-estimated in ESMs. Large-eddysimulations also tend to suggest an over-estimated aerosol effect on cloud lifetime in ESMs, but some report an aerosol-induced decrease in cloud cover that is at odds with satellite observations. Despite this potential disagreement when it comes to the dominant adjustment mechanism, a substantial negative contribution to ERFaci from adjustments is supported both by observational and modelling studies. Contributions to ERFaci from anthropogenic aerosols acting as INPs are generally not included in CMIP6 models. Two global modelling studies incorporating parameterizations based on recent laboratory studies both found a negative contribution to ERFaci, with central estimates of 0.3 and 0.13 W m-2, respectively. However, previous studies have produced model estimates"}

There is thus limited evidence and medium agreement for a small negative contribution to ERFaci from anthropogenic INP-induced cirrus modifications. Similarly, aerosol effects on deep convective clouds are typically not incorporated in ESMs. However, cloud-resolving modelling studies support non-negligible aerosol effects on the radiative properties of convective clouds and associated detrained cloud anvils. While global ERF estimates are currently not available for these effects, the fact that they are missing in most ESMs adds to the uncertainty range for the model-based ERFaci. From model-based evidence, ERFaci is assessed to 1.0  0.8 W m-2. This assessment uses the mean ERFaci in Table 7.6 as a starting point, but further allows for a small negative ERF contribution from cirrus clouds. The uncertainty range is based on those reported in Table 7.6, but widened to account for uncertain but likely non-negligible processes currently unaccounted for in ESMs. 7.3.3.2.3 Overall assessment of ERFaci The assessment of ERFaci based on observational evidence alone is very similar to the one based on model-evidence alone, in strong contrast to what was reported in AR5. This reconciliation of observation-based and model-based estimates is the result of considerable scientific progress and reflects comparable revisions of both model-based and observation-based estimates. The strong agreement between the two largely independent lines of evidence increases confidence in the overall assessment of the central estimate and very likely range for ERFaci of 1.0  0.7 W m-2. The assessed range is consistent with but narrower than that reported by the review of Bellouin et al. of 2.65 to 0.07 W m-2. The difference is primarily due to a wider range in the adjustment contribution to ERFaci in Bellouin et al., however adjustments reported relative to IRFaci ranging from 40% to 150% in that study are fully consistent with the ERFaci assessment presented here. 7.3.3.3 Energy budget constraints on the total aerosol ERF Energy balance models of reduced complexity have in recent years increasingly been combined with Monte Carlo approaches to provide valuable top-down observational constraints on the total aerosol ERF. These top-down approaches report ranges of aerosol ERF that are found to be consistent with the global mean temperature record and, in some cases, also observed ocean heat uptake. However, the total aerosol ERF is also used together with the historical temperature record in Section 7.5 to constrain ECS and TCR. Using top-down estimates as a separate line of evidence also for the total aerosol ERF would therefore be circular. Nevertheless, it is useful to examine the development of these estimates since AR5 and the degree to which these estimates are consistent with the upper and lower bounds of the assessments of total aerosol ERF. When the first top-down estimates emerged, it became clear that some of the early ESM estimates of total aerosol ERF were inconsistent with the plausible top-down range. However, as more inverse estimates have been published, it has increasingly become clear that they too are model-dependent and span a wide range of ERF estimates, with confidence intervals that in some cases do not overlap. It has also become evident that these methods are sensitive to revised estimates of other forcings and/or updates to observational data sets. A recent review of 19 such estimates reported a mean of 0.77 W m-2 for the total aerosol ERF, and a 95% confidence interval of 1.15 W m-2 to 0.31 W m-2. Adding to that review, a more recent study using the same approach reported an estimate of total aerosol ERF of 0.89 W m-2. However, in the same study, an alternative way of incorporating ocean heat content in the analysis produced a total aerosol ERF estimate of 1.34 W m-2, illustrating the sensitivity to the manner in which observations are included. A new approach to inverse estimates took advantage of independent climate radiative response estimates from eight prescribed SST and sea-ice concentration simulations over the historical period to estimate the total anthropogenic ERF. From this a total aerosol ERF of 0.8 W m-2 was derived. This range was found to be more invariant to"}

Beyond the inverse estimates described above, other efforts have been made since AR5 to constrain the total aerosol ERF. For example, Stevens used a simple model to simulate the historical total aerosol ERF evolution consistent with the observed temperature record. Given the lack of temporally extensive cooling trends in the 20th century record and the fact that the historical evolution of greenhouse gas forcing is relatively well constrained, the study concluded that a more negative total aerosol ERF than 1.0 W m-2 was incompatible with the historical temperature record. This was countered by Kretzschmar et al., who argued that the model employed in Stevens was too simplistic to account for the effect of geographical redistributions of aerosol emissions over time. Following the logic of Stevens, but basing their estimates on a subset of CMIP5 models as opposed to a simplified modelling framework, they argued that a total aerosol ERF as negative as 1.6 W m-2 was consistent with the observed temperature record. Similar arguments were put forward by Booth et al., who emphasized that the degree of nonlinearity of the total aerosol ERF with aerosol emission is a central assumption in Stevens. The historical temperature record was also the key observational constraint applied in two additional studies based on a subset of CMIP5 models. Rotstayn et al. found a strong temporal correlation between the total aerosol ERF and the global surface temperature. They used this relationship to produce a best estimate for the total aerosol ERF of 0.97 W m-2, but with considerable unquantified uncertainty, in part due to uncertainties in the TCR. Shindell et al. came to a similar best estimate for the total aerosol ERF of 1.0 W m-2 and a 95% confidence interval of 1.4 to 0.6 W m-2 but based this on spatial temperature and ERF patterns in the models in comparison with observed spatial temperature patterns. A separate observational constraint on the total ERF was proposed by Cherian et al., who compared trends in downward fluxes of solar radiation observed at surface stations across Europe to those simulated by a subset of CMIP5 models. Based on the relationship between solar radiation trends and the total aerosol ERF in the models, they inferred a total aerosol ERF of 1.3 W m-2 and a standard deviation of  0.4 W m-2. Based solely on energy balance considerations or other observational constraints, it is extremely likely that the total aerosol ERF is negative, but extremely unlikely that the total aerosol ERF is more negative than 2.0 W m-2. 7.3.3.4 Overall assessment of total aerosol ERF In AR5, the overall assessment of total aerosol ERF used the median of all ESM estimates published prior to AR5 of 1.5 W m-2 as a starting point, but placed more confidence in a subset of models that were deemed more complete in their representation of aerosol-cloud interactions. These models, which included aerosol effects on mixed-phase, ice and/or convective clouds, produced a smaller estimate of 1.38 W m-2. Likewise, studies that constrained models with satellite observations, which produced a median estimate of 0.85 W m-2, were given extra weight. Furthermore, a longwave ERFaci of 0.2 W m-2 was added to studies that only reported shortwave ERFaci values. Finally, based on higher resolution models, doubt was raised regarding the ability of ESMs to represent the cloud adjustment component of ERFaci with fidelity. The expert judgement was therefore that aerosol effects on cloud lifetime were too strong in the ESMs, further reducing the overall ERF estimate. The above lines of argument resulted in a total aerosol assessment of 0.9 W m-2 in AR5. Here, the best estimate and range is revised relative to AR5, partly based on updates to the above lines of argument. Firstly, the studies that included aerosol effects on mixed-phase clouds in AR5 relied on the assumption that anthropogenic black carbon could act as INPs in these clouds, which has since been challenged by laboratory experiments. There is no observational evidence of appreciable ERFs associated with aerosol effects on mixed-phase and ice clouds, and modelling studies disagree when it comes to both their magnitude and sign"}

Likewise, very few ESMs incorporate aerosol effects on deep convective clouds, and cloud-resolving modelling studies report different effects on cloud radiative properties depending on environmental conditions. Thus, it is not clear whether omitting such effects in ESMs would lead to any appreciable ERF biases, or if so, what the sign of such biases would be. As a result, all ESMs are given equal weight in this assessment. Furthermore, there is now a considerably expanded body of literature which suggests that early modelling studies that incorporated satellite observations may have resulted in overly conservative estimates of the magnitude of ERFaci. Finally, based on an assessment of the longwave ERFaci in the CMIP5 models, the offset of +0.2 W m-2 applied in AR5 appears to be too large. As in AR5, there is still reason to question the ability of ESMs to simulate adjustments in LWP and cloud cover in response to aerosol perturbation, but it is not clear that this will result in biases that exclusively increase the magnitude of the total aerosol ERF. The assessment of total aerosol ERF here uses the following lines of evidence: satellite-based evidence for IRFari, model-based evidence for IRFari and ERFari, satellite-based evidence of IRF/ERFaci, and finally model-based evidence for ERFaci. Based on this, ERFari and ERFaci for 2014 relative to 1750 are assessed to 0.3  0.3 W m-2 and 1.0  0.7 W m-2, respectively. There is thus strong evidence for a substantive negative total aerosol ERF, which is supported by the broad agreement between observation-based and model-based lines of evidence for both ERFari and ERFaci that has emerged since AR5. However, considerable uncertainty remains, particularly with regards to the adjustment contribution to ERFaci, as well as missing processes in current ESMs, notably aerosol effects on mixed-phase, ice and convective clouds. This leads to a medium confidence in the estimate of ERFari+aci and a slight narrowing of the uncertainty range. Because the estimates informing the different lines of evidence are generally valid for approximately 2014 conditions, the total aerosol ERF assessment is considered valid for 2014 relative to 1750. Combining the lines of evidence and adding uncertainties in quadrature, the ERFari+aci estimated for 2014 relative to 1750 is assessed to be 1.3 W m-2. The corresponding range from Bellouin et al. is 3.15 to 0.35 W m-2, thus there is agreement for the upper bound while the lower bound assessed here is less negative. A lower bound more negative than -2.0 W m-2 is not supported by any of the assessed lines of evidence. There is high confidence that ERFaci contributes most to the total aerosol effect. In contrast to AR5, it is now virtually certain that the total aerosol ERF is negative. Figure 7.5 depicts the aerosol ERFs from the different lines of evidence along with the overall assessments. As most modelling and observational estimates of aerosol ERF have end points in 2014 or earlier, there is limited evidence available for the assessment of how aerosol ERF has changed from 2014 to 2019. However, based on a general reduction in global mean AOD over this period, combined with a reduction in emissions of aerosols and their precursors in updated emission inventories, the aerosol ERF is assessed to have decreased in magnitude from about 2014 to 2019. Consistent with Chapter 2, Figure 2.10, the change in aerosol ERF from about 2014 to 2019 is assessed to be +0.2 W m-2, but with low confidence due to limited evidence. Aerosols are therefore assessed to have contributed an ERF of 1.1 W m2 over 17502019. Figure 7.5: Net aerosol effective radiative forcing from different lines of evidence. The headline AR6 assessment of 1.3 W m2 is highlighted in purple for 17502014 and compared to the AR5 assessment of 0.9 W m2 for 17502011.

Changes in solar irradiance, galactic cosmic rays and volcanic eruptions since pre-industrial times combined represent the natural contribution to the total ERF and are discussed in Sections 7.3.4.4, 7.3.4.5 and 7.3.4.6. 7.3.4.1 Land use Land use forcing is defined as those changes in land surface properties directly caused by human activity rather than by climate processes. Land use change affects the surface albedo. For example, deforestation typically replaces darker forested areas with brighter cropland, and thus imposes a negative radiative forcing on climate, while afforestation and reforestation can have the opposite effect. Precise changes depend on the nature of the forest, crops and underlying soil. Land use change also affects the amount of water transpired by vegetation. Irrigation of land directly affects the evaporation causing a global increase of 32 500 m3 s1 due to human activity. Changes in evaporation and transpiration affect the latent heat budget, but do not directly affect the top-ofatmosphere radiative fluxes. The lifetime of water vapour is so short that the effect of changes in evaporation on the greenhouse contribution of water vapour are negligible. However, evaporation can affect the ERF through adjustments, particularly through changes in low cloud amounts. Land management affects the emissions or removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. These emission changes have the greatest effect on climate, however they are already included in greenhouse gas inventories. Land use change also affects the emissions of dust and biogenic volatile organic compounds, which form aerosols and affect the atmospheric concentrations of ozone and methane. The effects of land use on surface temperature and hydrology were recently assessed in SRCCL. Using the definition of ERF from Section 7.1, the adjustment in land surface temperature is excluded from the definition of ERF, but changes in vegetation and snow cover are included. Land use change in the mid-latitudes induces a substantial amplifying adjustment in snow cover. Few climate model studies have attempted to quantify the ERF of land use change. Andrews et al. calculated a very large surface albedo ERF from 1860 to 2005 in the HadGEM2-ES model although they did not separate out the surface albedo change from snow cover change. HadGEM2-ES is known to overestimate the amount of boreal trees and shrubs in the unperturbed state so will tend to overestimate the ERF associated with land use change. The increases in dust in HadGEM2-ES contributed an extra 0.25 W m2, whereas cloud cover changes added a small positive adjustment consistent with a reduction in transpiration. A multi-model quantification of land use forcing in CMIP6 models found an IRF of 0.15  0.12 W m2, and an ERF of 0.11  0.09 W m2. This shows a small positive adjustment term (mainly from a reduction in cloud cover. CMIP5 models show an IRF of 0.11 W m-2 after excluding unrealistic models. The contribution of land use change to albedo changes has recently been investigated using MODIS and AVHRR to attribute surface albedo to geographically-specific land cover types. When combined with a historical land use map this gives a 1700 to 2005 SARF of 0.15  0.01 W m-2. This study accounted for correlations between"}

The indirect contributions of land use change through biogenic emissions is very uncertain. Decreases in biogenic volatile organic compounds reduce ozone and methane, but also reduce the formation of organic aerosols and their effects of clouds Scott et al.. Adjustments through changes in aerosols and chemistry are model dependent, and it is not yet possible to make an assessment based on a limited number of studies. The contribution of irrigation is assessed as 0.05 W m-2 for the historical period. Since the CMIP5 and CMIP6 modelling studies are in agreement with Ghimire et al., that study is used as the assessed albedo ERF. Adding the irrigation effect to this gives an overall assessment of the ERF from land use change of 0.20  0.10 W m-2. Changes in ERF since 2014 are assumed to be small compared to the uncertainty, so this ERF applies to the period 1750 to 2019. The uncertainty range includes uncertainties in the adjustments. 7.3.4.2 Contrails and aviation-induced cirrus ERF from contrails and aviation-induced cirrus is taken from the assessment of Lee et al., at 0.057 W m2 in 2018. This is rounded up to address its low confidence and the extra year of air traffic to give an assessed ERF over 17502019 of 0.06. This assessment is given low confidence due to the potential for missing processes to affect the magnitude of contrails and aviation-induced cirrus ERF. 7.3.4.3 Light absorbing particles on snow and ice In AR5, it was assessed that the effects of light absorbing particles did probably not significantly contribute to recent reductions in Arctic ice and snow. The SARF from LAPs on snow and ice was assessed to +0.04 W m-2, a range appreciably lower than the estimates given in AR4. This effect was assessed to be low confidence. Since AR5 there has been progress in the understanding of the physical state and processes in snow that governs the albedo reduction by black carbon. The SROCC assessed that there is high confidence that darkening of snow by deposition of BC and other light absorbing aerosol species increases the rate of snow melt. He et al. found that taking into account the non-spherical shape of snow grains and internal mixing of BC in snow both significantly altered the effects of BC on snow albedo. The reductions of snow albedo by dust and black carbon have been measured and characterised in the Arctic, the Tibetan Plateau, and mid latitude regions subject to seasonal snowfall including North America and Northern and Eastern Asia. Since AR5, two further studies of global IRF from black carbon on snow deposition are available, with best estimates of 0.01 W m-2 and 0.04 W m2. Organic carbon deposition on snow and ice has been estimated to contribute a small positive IRF of 0.001 to 0.003 W m2. No comprehensive global assessments of mineral dust deposition on snow are available, although the effects are potentially large in relation to the total LAPs on snow and ice forcing. Most radiative forcing estimates have a regional emphasis. The regional focus makes estimating a global mean radiative forcing from aggregating different studies challenging, and the relative importance of each region is expected to change if the global pattern of emission sources changes. The lower bound of the assessed range of black carbon on snow and ice is extended to zero to encompass Lin et al."}

The efficacy of black carbon on snow forcing was estimated to be 2 to 4 times as large as for an equivalent CO2 forcing as the effects are concentrated at high latitudes in the cryosphere. However, it is unclear how much of this effect is due to radiative adjustments leading to a higher ERF, and how much comes from a less negative feedback  due the high latitude nature of the forcing. To estimate the overall ERF, the IRF is doubled assuming that part of the increased efficacy is due to adjustments. This gives an overall assessed ERF of +0.08 W m2, with low confidence. 7.3.4.4 Solar Variations in the total solar irradiance represent a natural external forcing agent. The dominant cycle is the solar 11-year activity cycle, which is superimposed on longer cycles. Over the last three 11-year cycles, the peak-to-trough amplitude in TSI has differed by about 1 W m2 between solar maxima and minima. The fractional variability in the solar irradiance, over the solar cycle and between solar cycles, is much greater at short wavelengths in the 200400 nm band than for the broad visible/IR band that dominates TSI. The IRF can be derived simply by TSI/4 irrespective of wavelength, where the best estimate of the planetary albedo is usually taken to be 0.29 and TSI represents the change in total solar irradiance.. The adjustments are expected to be wavelength dependent. Gray et al. determined a stratospheric temperature adjustment of 22% to spectrally resolved changes in the solar radiance over one solar cycle. This negative adjustment is due to stratospheric heating from increased absorption by ozone at the short wavelengths, increasing the outgoing longwave radiation to space. A multi-model comparison calculated adjustments of 4% due to stratospheric temperatures and 6% due to tropospheric processes, for a change in TSI across the spectrum. The smaller magnitude of the stratospheric temperature adjustment is consistent with the broad spectral change rather than the shorter wavelengths characteristic of solar variation. A single model study also found an adjustment that acts to reduce the forcing. While there has not yet been a calculation based on the appropriate spectral change, the 6% tropospheric adjustment from Smith et al. is adopted along with the Gray et al. stratospheric temperature adjustment. The ERF due to solar variability over the historical period is therefore represented by 0.72  TSI/4 using the TSI timeseries from Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1. AR5 assessed solar SARF from around 1750 to 2011 to be 0.05 W m2 which was computed from the seven-year mean around the solar minima in 1745 and 2008. The inclusion of tropospheric adjustments that reduce ERF has a negligible effect on the overall forcing. Prior to the satellite era, proxy records are used to reconstruct historical solar activity. In AR5, historical records were constructed using observations of solar magnetic features. In this assessment historical time series are constructed from radiogenic compounds in the biosphere and in ice cores that are formed from cosmic rays. In this assessment the TSI from the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 4 reconstruction is used. Proxies constructed from the 14C and 10Be radiogenic records for the SATIRE-M model and 14C record for the PMOD model for the 1745 solar minimum provide 1745 to 2008 ERFs of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.00 W m-2 respectively. An independent dataset from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Climate Data Record provides a 1745 to 2008 ERF of +0.03 W m-2. One substantially higher ERF estimate of +0.35 W m-2 derived from TSI reconstructions is provided by Egorova et al.. However, the estimate from Egorova et al. hinges on assumptions about long-term changes in the quiet Sun for which there is no observed evidence. Lockwood and Ball analysed the relationship of observed changes in cosmic ray fluxes and recent, more accurate, TSI data and derived ERF between 0.01 and +0.02 W m-2 and Yeo et al. modelling showed the"}

Carbon dioxide continues to contribute the largest part of this GHG ERF. As discussed in Section 7.3.3, aerosols have in total contributed an ERF of 1.1 W m2 over 1750-2019. Aerosol-cloud interactions contribute approximately 7580% to this ERF with the remainder due to aerosol-radiation interactions. For the purpose of comparing forcing changes with historical temperature change, longer averaging periods are useful. The change in ERF from the second half of the 19th century compared with a recent period is 2.20 W m2, of which 1.71 W m2 is due to CO2. 7.3.5.3 Temperature Contribution of forcing agents The estimated contribution of forcing agents to the 2019 global surface air temperature change relative to 1750 is shown in Figure 7.7. These estimates were produced using concentration-derived ERF timeseries presented in Chapter 2, Figure 2.10 and described in Supplementary Material 7.SM.1.3. The resulting GSAT changes over time are shown in Figure 7.8. The historical timeseries of ERFs for the WMGHGs can be derived by applying the ERF calculations of Section 7.3.2 to the observed timeseries of WMGHG concentrations in Chapter 2, Section 2.2. These ERF timeseries are combined with a two-layer emulator using a 2,237-member constrained Monte Carlo sample of both forcing uncertainty and climate response. The net model warming over the historical period is matched to the assessment of historical GSAT warming from 18501900 to 19952014 of 0.85C and ocean heat content change from 1971 to 2018, therefore the model gives the breakdown of the GSAT trend associated with different forcing mechanisms that are consistent with the overall GSAT change. The model assumes that there is no variation in feedback parameter across forcing mechanism and variations in the effective feedback parameter over the historical record. The distribution of ECS was informed by Section 7.5.5 and chosen to approximately maintain the best estimate and likely/very likely ranges assessed in that section. The TCR has an ensemble median value of 1.81C, in good agreement with Section 7.5.5. Two error bars are shown in Figure 7.7. The dashed error bar shows the contribution of ERF uncertainty employing the best estimate of climate response with an ECS of 3.0 C. The solid bar is the total response uncertainty using the Section 7.5.5 assessment of ECS. The uncertainty in the historic temperature contributions for the different forcing agents are mostly due to uncertainties in ERF, yet for the WMGHG the uncertainty is dominated by the climate response as its ERF is relatively well known. From the assessment of emulator responses in Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, there is high confidence that calibrated emulators such as the one employed here can represent the historical GSAT change from 18501900 to 19952014 to within 5% for the best estimate and 10% for the very likely range. This gives high confidence in the overall assessment of GSAT change for the response to ERFs over 17502019 derived from the emulator. The total human forced GSAT change from 17502019 is calculated to be 1.29 C. Although the total emulated GSAT change has high confidence, the confidence of the individual contributions matches those given for the ERF assessment in Section 7.3 subsections. The calculated GSAT change is comprised of a well-mixed greenhouse gas warming of 1.58 C, a warming from ozone changes of 0.23 C, a cooling of 0.50 C from aerosol effects. The aerosol cooling has considerable regional time dependence but has weakened slightly over the last 20 years in the global mean. There is also a 0.06 C contribution from surface reflectance changes which dominated by land-use change. Changes in solar and volcanic activity are assessed to have together contributed a small change of 0.02 C since"}

These changes in greenhouse gases and aerosol amount have the potential to alter the TOA energy budget and are collectively referred to as non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks. CH4 and N2O feedbacks arise partly from changes in their emissions from natural sources in response to temperature change; these are assessed in Chapter 5, Section 5.4.7. Here we exclude the permafrost CH4 feedback because, although associated emissions are projected to increase under warming on multi-decadal to centennial timescales, on longer timescales these emissions would eventually substantially decline as the permafrost carbon pools were depleted. This leaves the wetland CH4, land N2O, and ocean N2O feedbacks, the assessed mean values of which sum to a positive feedback parameter of +0.04 W m2 C1. Other non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks that are relevant to the net feedback parameter are assessed in Chapter 6, Section 6.4.5. These feedbacks are associated with sea salt, dimethyl sulphide, dust, ozone, biogenic volatile organic compounds, lightning, and CH4 lifetime, and sum to a negative feedback parameter of 0.20 W m2 C1. The overall feedback parameter for non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks is obtained by summing the Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 assessments, which gives 0.16 W m2 C1. However, there is low confidence in the estimates of both the individual non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks as well as their total effect, as evident from the large range in the magnitudes of  from different studies, which can be attributed to diversity in how models account for these feedbacks and limited process-level understanding. 7.4.2.5.2 Biogeophysical feedbacks Biogeophysical feedbacks are associated with changes in the spatial distribution and/or biophysical properties of vegetation, induced by surface temperature change and attendant hydrological cycle change. These vegetation changes can alter radiative fluxes directly via albedo changes, or via surface momentum or moisture flux changes and hence changes in cloud properties. However, the direct physiological response of vegetation to changes in CO2, including changes in stomatal conductance, is considered part of the CO2 effective radiative forcing rather than a feedback. The timescale of response of vegetation to climate change is relatively uncertain but can be from decades to hundreds of years, and could occur abruptly or as a tipping point; equilibrium only occurs when the soil system and associated nutrient and carbon pools equilibrate, which can take millennia. The overall effects of climate-induced vegetation changes may be comparable in magnitude to those from anthropogenic land-use and land cover change. Climate models that include a dynamical representation of vegetation are used to explore the importance of biogeophysical feedbacks. In AR5, it was discussed that such model experiments predicted that expansion of vegetation in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere would enhance warming due to the associated surface albedo change, and that reduction of tropical forests in response to climate change would lead to regional surface warming, due to reduced evapotranspiration, but there was no assessment of the associated feedback parameter. SRCCL stated that regional climate change can be dampened or enhanced by changes in local land cover, but that this depends on the location and the season; however, in general the focus was on anthropogenic land cover change, and no assessment of the biogeophysical feedback parameter was carried out. There are also indications of a marine biogeophysical feedback associated with surface albedo change due to changes in phytoplankton, but there is not currently enough evidence to quantitatively assess this feedback. Since AR5, several studies have confirmed that a shift from tundra to boreal forests and the associated albedo change leads to increased warming in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. However, regional modelling indicates that vegetation feedbacks may act to cool climate in the Mediterranean, and in the tropics and subtropics the regional response is in general not consistent across models. On a global scale, several modelling studies have either carried out a feedback analysis (Stocker et al., 2013; Willeit et al.,"}

Their time evolution is determined by both their surface mass balance and ice dynamic processes, with the latter being particularly important for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Surface mass balance depends on the net energy and hydrological fluxes at their surface, and there are mechanisms of ice sheet instability that depend on ocean temperatures and basal melt rates. The presence of ice sheets affects Earths radiative budget, hydrology, and atmospheric circulation due to their characteristic high albedo, low roughness length, and high altitude, and they influence ocean circulation through freshwater input from calving and melt. Ice sheet changes also modify surface albedo through the attendant change in sea level and therefore land area. The timescale for ice sheets to reach equilibrium is on the order of thousands of years. Due to the long timescales involved, it is a major challenge to run coupled climate-ice sheet models to equilibrium, and as a result, long-term simulations are often carried out with lower complexity models, and/or are asynchronously coupled. In AR5, it was described that both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets would continue to lose mass in a warming world, with a continuation in sea level rise beyond the year 2500 assessed as virtually certain. However, there was low confidence in the associated radiative feedback mechanisms, and as such, there was no assessment of the magnitude of long-term radiative feedbacks associated with ice sheets. That assessment is consistent with SROCC, wherein it was stated that with limited published studies to draw from and no simulations run beyond 2100, firm conclusions regarding the net importance of atmospheric versus ocean melt feedbacks on the long-term future of Antarctica cannot be made. The magnitude of the radiative feedback associated with changes to ice sheets can be quantified by comparing the global mean long-term equilibrium temperature response to increased CO2 concentrations in simulations that include interactive ice sheets with that of simulations that do not include the associated icesheet climate interactions. These simulations indicate that on multi-centennial timescales, ice sheet mass loss leads to fresh water fluxes that can modify ocean circulation. This leads to reduced surface warming, although other work suggests no net global temperature effect of ice sheet mass loss. However, model simulations in which the Antarctic ice sheet is removed completely in a paleoclimate context indicate a positive global mean feedback on multi-millennial timescales due primarily to the surface albedo change; in Chapter 9 it is assessed that such icefree conditions could eventually occur given 713C of warming. This net positive feedback due to ice sheets on long timescales is also supported by model simulations of the mid-Pliocene warm period in which the volume and area of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are reduced in model simulations in agreement with geological data, leading to surface warming. As such, overall, on multi-centennial timescales the feedback parameter associated with ice sheets is likely negative, but on multi-millennial timescales by the time the ice sheets reach equilibrium, the feedback parameter is very likely positive. However, a relative lack of models carrying out simulations with and without interactive ice sheets over centennial to millennial timescales means that there is currently not enough evidence to quantify the magnitude of these feedbacks, or the timescales on which they act. 7.4.2.7 Synthesis Table 7.10 summarises the estimates and the assessment of the individual and the net feedbacks presented in the above sections. The uncertainty range of the net climate feedback was obtained by adding standard deviations of individual feedbacks in quadrature, assuming that they are independent and follow the Gaussian distribution. It is virtually certain that the net climate feedback is negative, primarily due to the Planck temperature response, indicating that climate acts to stabilise in response to radiative forcing imposed to the system. Supported by the level of confidence associated with the individual feedbacks, it is also"}

The transient adjustment of the equatorial Pacific SST gradient is influenced by upwelling waters which delay surface warming in the east since they have not been at the surface for years-to-decades to experience the greenhouse gas forcing. This thermostat mechanism is not thought to persist to equilibrium since it does not account for the eventual increase in temperatures of upwelled waters which will occur as the subducting waters in mid-latitudes warm by more than the tropics on average as polar amplification emerges. An individual CMIP5 ESM has been found to exhibit a La Ninalike pattern of Pacific temperature change through the 21st century, similar to the SST trends seen over the historical record, owing to a weakening asymmetry between El Nino and La Nina events, but this pattern of warming may not persist to equilibrium. Since 1870, observed SSTs in the tropical western Pacific Ocean have increased while those in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean have changed less. Much of the resultant strengthening of the equatorial Pacific temperature gradient has occurred since about 1980 due to strong warming in the west and cooling in the east concurrent with an intensification of the surface equatorial easterly trade winds and Walker Circulation. This temperature pattern is also reflected in regional ocean heat content trends and sea level changes observed from satellite altimetry since 1993. The observed changes may have been influenced by one or a combination of temporary factors including sulphate aerosol forcing, internal variability within the Indo-Pacific Ocean, teleconnections from multi-decadal tropical Atlantic SST trends, teleconnections from multi-decadal Southern Ocean SST trends, and coupled oceanatmosphere dynamics which slow warming in the equatorial eastern Pacific. CMIP3 and CMIP5 ESMs have difficulties replicating the observed trends in the Walker Circulation and Pacific Ocean SSTs over the historical record, possibly due to model deficiencies including insufficient multi-decadal Pacific Ocean SST variability, mean state biases affecting the forced response or the connection between Atlantic and Pacific basins, and/or a misrepresentation of radiative forcing. However, the observed trends in the Pacific Ocean SSTs are still within the range of internal variability as simulated by large initial condition ensembles of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Because the causes of observed equatorial Pacific temperature gradient and Walker circulation trends are not well understood, there is low confidence in their attribution to anthropogenic influences, while there is medium confidence that the observed changes have resulted from internal variability. 7.4.4.2.2 Tropical Pacific temperature gradients in past high-CO2 climates AR5 stated that paleoclimate proxies indicate a reduction in the longitudinal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific during the mid-Pliocene warm period. This assessment was based on SST reconstructions between two sites situated very close to the equator in the heart of the western Pacific warm pool and eastern Pacific cold tongue, respectively. Multiple SST reconstructions based on independent paleoclimate proxies generally agreed that during the Pliocene the SST gradient between these two sites was reduced compared with the modern long-term mean. Since AR5, the generation of new SST records has led to a variety of revised gradient estimates, specifically the generation of a new record for the warm pool, the inclusion of SST reconstructions"}

In this Report, the effective ECS is inferred from estimates that use global coverage of GSAT to estimate the surface temperature trends. The GSAT trend is assessed to have the same best estimate as the observed global mean surface temperature, although the GSAT trend is assessed to have larger uncertainty. Many previous studies have relied on HadCRUT4 GMST estimates that used the blended observations and did not interpolate over regions of incomplete observational coverage such as the Arctic. As a result, the ECS and TCR derived from these studies has smaller ECS and TCR values than those derived from model-inferred estimates. The energy budget studies assessing ECS in AR5 employed HadCRUT4 or similar measures of GMST trends. As other lines of evidence in that report used GSAT trends, this could partly explain why AR5-based energy budget estimates of ECS were lower than those estimated from other lines of evidence, adding to the overall disparity in Collins et al.. In this report, GSAT is chosen as the standard measure of global surface temperature to aid comparison with previous model and process-based estimates of ECS, TCR and climate feedbacks. The traditional energy budget framework has been evaluated within ESM simulations by comparing the effective ECS estimated under historical forcing with the ECS estimated using regression methods under abrupt4xCO2. For one CMIP6 model, the value of effective ECS derived from historical energy budget constraints is 1.8C while ECS is estimated to be 5.0C. For another model the effective ECS derived from historical energy budget constraints is 4.1C while ECS is estimated to be 5.5C. These modelling results suggest that the effective ECS under historical forcing could be lower than the true ECS owing to differences in radiative feedbacks induced by the distinct patterns of historical and equilibrium warming. Using GFDL-CM4, Winton et al. also find that the value of TCR estimated from energy budget constraints within a historical simulation is substantially lower than the true value of TCR diagnosed within a 1pctCO2 simulation owing to a combination of the pattern effect and differences in the efficiency of ocean heat uptake between historical and 1pctCO2 forcing. This section next considers how the true ECS can be estimated from the historical energy budget by accounting for the pattern effect. However, owing to limited evidence this section does not attempt to account for these effects in estimates of TCR. Research since AR5 has introduced extensions to the traditional energy budget framework that account for the feedback dependence on temperature patterns by allowing for multiple radiative feedbacks operating on different timescales, by allowing feedbacks to vary with the spatial pattern or magnitude of ocean heat uptake, or by allowing feedbacks to vary with the type of radiative forcing agent. A direct way to account for the pattern effect is to use the relationship ECS = F2CO2/( + ), where  =/T is the effective feedback parameter estimated from historical global energy budget changes and  represents the change in the feedback parameter between the historical period and the equilibrium response to CO2 forcing, which can be estimated using ESMs. The net radiative feedback change between the historical warming pattern and the projected equilibrium warming pattern in response to CO2 forcing is estimated to be in the range 0.0 to 1.0 W m2 C1. Using the value  = +0.5  0.5 W m2 C 1 to represent this range illustrates the effect of changing radiative feedbacks on estimates of ECS. While the effective ECS inferred from historical warming is 2.5 C , ECS = F2CO2/( + ) is 3.5 C. For comparison, values of  derived from the response to historical and idealized CO2 forcing within coupled climate models can be approximated as  = +0.1  0.3 W m2 C1, corresponding to a value of ECS of 2.7 C. In both cases, the low end of the ECS range is similar to that of the effective ECS inferred using the traditional energy balance model framework that assumes  = 0, reflecting a weak dependence on the value of  when ECS is small"}

However, the high end of the ECS range is substantially larger than that of the effective ECS and strongly dependent on the value of . The values of ECS obtained from the techniques outlined above are all higher than those estimated from both AR5 and recently published estimates. Four revisions made in this Report are responsible for this increase: An upwards revision of historic global surface temperature trends from newly published trend estimates; An 8% increase in the ERF for F2CO2; A more negative central estimate of aerosol ERF, which acts to reduce estimates of historical ERF trends; and Accounting for the pattern effect in ECS estimates. Values of ECS provided here are similar to those based on the historical energy budget found in Sherwood et al., with small differences owing to methodological differences and the use of different estimates of observed warming, Earths energy imbalance, and ERF. Overall, there is high confidence that the true ECS is higher than the effective ECS as inferred from the historical global energy budget, but there is substantial uncertainty in how much higher because of limited evidence regarding how radiative feedbacks may change in the future. While several lines of evidence indicate that  > 0, the quantitative accuracy of feedback changes is not known at this time. Global energy budget constraints thus provide high confidence in the lower bound of ECS which is not sensitive to the value of : ECS is extremely unlikely to be less than 1.6C. Estimates of  that are informed by idealized CO2 forcing simulations of coupled ESMs indicate a median value of ECS of around 2.7C while estimates of  that are informed by observed historical sea surface temperature patterns indicate a median value of ECS of around 3.5C. Owing to large uncertainties in future feedback changes, the historical energy budget currently provides little information about the upper end of the ECS range. 7.5.2.2 Estimates of ECS and TCR based on climate model emulators Energy budget emulators are far less complex than comprehensive ESMs. For example, an emulator could represent the atmosphere, ocean, and land using a small number of connected boxes, or it could represent the global mean climate using two connected ocean layers. The numerical efficiency of emulators means that they can be empirically constrained by observations: a large number of possible parameter values are randomly drawn from prior distributions; forward integrations of the model are performed with these parameters and weighted against observations of surface or ocean warming, producing posterior estimates of quantities of interest such as TCR, ECS and aerosol forcing. Owing to their reduced complexity, emulators lack full representations of the spatial patterns of sea surface temperature and radiative responses to changes in those patterns and many represent the net feedback parameter using a constant value. The ranges of ECS reported by studies using emulators are thus interpreted here as representative of the effective ECS over the historical record rather than of the true ECS. Improved estimates of ocean heat uptake over the past two decades have diminished the role of ocean diffusivity in driving uncertainty in ECS estimates, leaving the main trade-off between posterior ranges in ECS and aerosol radiative forcing. AR5 assessed a variety of estimates of ECS based on emulators and found that they were sensitive to the choice of prior parameter distributions and temperature datasets used, particularly for the upper end of the ECS range, though priors can be chosen to minimize the effect on results. Emulators generally produced estimates of effective ECS between 1C and 5C and ranges of TCR between 0.9C and 2.6C. Padilla et al. use a simple global-average emulator with two timescales to estimate a TCR of 1.6 C. Using the same model, Schwartz finds TCR in the range 0.91.9C while Schwartz finds that an effective ECS of 1.7C provides the best fit to the historical global surface temperature record while also"}

The increase in any metric due to the carbon cycle response can be derived from the convolution of the global surface temperature response with the CO2 flux response to temperature and the equivalent metric for CO2. Including this response also increases the duration of the effect of short-lived greenhouse gases on climate. An alternative way of accounting for the carbon cycle temperature response would be to incorporate it into the temperature response function. If this were done, the correction could be excluded from both the CO2 and non-CO2 forcing responses as in Hodnebrog et al.. Including the carbon cycle response for non-CO2 treats CO2 and non-CO2 compounds consistently and therefore we assess that its inclusion more accurately represents the climate effects of non-CO2 species. There is high confidence in the methodology of using carbon cycle models for calculating the carbon cycle response. The magnitude of the carbon cycle response contributions to the emission metrics vary by a factor of two between Sterner and Johansson and Gasser et al.. The central values are taken from Gasser et al. as the OSCAR 2.2 model used is based on parameters derived from CMIP5 models, and the climate-carbon feedback magnitude is therefore similar to the CMIP5 multi-model mean. As values have only been calculated in two simple parameterised carbon cycle models the uncertainty is assessed to be 100%. Due to few studies and a factor of two difference between them, there is low confidence that the magnitude of the carbon cycle response is within the higher end of this uncertainty range, but high confidence that the sign is positive. Carbon cycle responses are included in all the metrics presented in Tables 7.15 and Supplementary Table 7.SM.7. The carbon cycle contribution is lower than in AR5, but there is high confidence in the need for its inclusion and the method by which it is quantified. Emissions of non-CO2 species can affect the carbon cycle in other ways: emissions of ozone precursors can reduce the carbon uptake by plants; emissions of reactive nitrogen species can fertilize plants and hence increase the carbon uptake; and emissions of aerosols or their precursors can affect the utilisation of light by plants. There is robust evidence that these processes occur and are important, but insufficient evidence to determine the magnitude of their contributions to emission metrics. Ideally, emission metrics should include all indirect effects to be consistent, but limits to our knowledge restrict how much can be included in practice. Indirect contributions from chemical production or destruction of other greenhouse gases are quantified in Chapter 6, Section 6.4. For methane, AR5 assessed that the contributions from effects on ozone and stratospheric water vapour add 50%  30% and 15%  11% to the emission-based ERF, which were equivalent to 1.8  0.7 104 and 0.5  0.4 104 W m-2 ppb-1. In AR6 the radiative efficiency formulation is preferred as it is independent of the assumed radiative efficiency for methane. The assessed contributions to the radiative efficiency for methane due to ozone are 1.4  0.7 104 W m-2 ppb-1, based on 0.14 W m-2 forcing from a 1023 ppb methane change. The contribution from stratospheric water vapour is 0.4  0.4 104 W m-2 ppb-1, based on 0.05 W m-2 forcing from a 1137 ppb methane change. N2O depletes upper stratospheric ozone and reduces the methane lifetime. In AR5 the methane lifetime effect was assessed to reduce methane concentrations by 0.36 ppb per ppb increase in N2O, with no assessment of the effective radiative forcing from ozone. This is now increased to 1.7 ppb methane per ppb N2O (based on a methane lifetime decrease of 4%  4% for a 55 ppb increase in N2O and a radiative efficiency of 5.5  0.4 104 W m-2 ppb-1 through ozone. In summary, GWPs and GTPs for methane and nitrous oxide are slightly lower than in AR5 due to revisions in their lifetimes and updates to their indirect chemical effects. Methane can also affect the oxidation pathways of aerosol formation but the available literature is insufficient to make a robust assessment of this. Hydrocarbon and molecular hydrogen oxidation also leads to tropospheric ozone production and change in methane lifetime.

If global surface temperature stabilization goals are considered, cumulative CO2 equivalent emissions computed with the GWP-100 emission metric would continue to rise when short-lived greenhouse gas emissions are reduced but remain above zero. Such as rise would not match the expected global surface temperature stabilization or potential decline in warming that comes from a reduction in emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases. This is relevant to net zero greenhouse gas emission goals. When individual gases are treated separately in climate model emulators, or weighted and aggregated using an emission metric approach which translate the distinct behaviour from cumulative emissions of short-lived gases, ambiguity in the future warming trajectory of a given emission scenario can be substantially reduced. The degree of ambiguity varies with the emissions scenario. For mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2C with an even chance, the ambiguity arising from using GWP100 as sole constraint on emissions of a mix of greenhouse gases could be as much as 0.17C, which represents about one fifth of the remaining global warming in those pathways. If the evolution of the individual GHGs are not known, this can make it difficult to evaluate how a given global multi-gas emission pathway specified only in CO2 equivalent emissions would achieve global surface temperature goals. This is potentially an issue as Nationally Determined Contributions frequently make commitments in terms of GWP-100 based CO2equivalent emissions at 2030 without specifying individual gases. Clear and transparent representation of the global warming implications of future emission pathways including Nationally Determined Contributions could be achieved either by their detailing pathways for multiple gases or by detailing a pathway of cumulative carbon dioxide equivalent emission approach aggregated across greenhouse gases evaluated by either GWP* or CGTP metric approaches. Note that although the Paris Agreement Rulebook asks countries to report emissions of individual greenhouse gases separately for the global stocktake which can allow the current effects of their emissions on global surface temperature to be accurately estimated, estimates of future warming are potentially ambiguous where emissions are aggregated using GWP-100 or other pulse metrics. Although there is significant history of using single-basket approaches, supported by emission metrics such as GWP-100, in climate policies such as the Kyoto Protocol, multi-basket approaches also have many precedents in environmental management, including the Montreal Protocol. Further assessment of the performance of physical and economics-based metrics in the context of climate change mitigation is provided in the contribution of Working Group III to the AR6. 7.6.2 Applications of emission metrics One prominent use of emission metrics is for comparison of efforts measured against climate change goals or targets. One of the most commonly discussed goals are in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement which aims to limit the risks and impacts of climate change by setting temperature goals. In addition, the Paris Agreement has important provisions which relate to how the goals are to be achieved, including making emissions reductions in a manner that does not threaten food production, an early emissions peaking target, and the aim to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century. Article 4 also contains important context regarding international equity, sustainable development, and poverty reduction. Furthermore, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change sets out as its ultimate objective, the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous"}

Using the Etminan et al. fits with the same baseline concentrations results in a SARF of 3.80 W m2 and an ERF of 3.99 W m-2. The simplified expressions are used as no specific line-by-line experiment was performed for a doubling of CO2 from about 1750 concentrations in Etminan et al.. Alongside the choice of simplified expression, the baseline CO2 and N2O concentrations also has an impact on the SARF and ERF from a doubling of CO2. Using 1850 CE baselines results in ERF values that are close, but not exactly the same, as using 1750 CE baselines. Using a presentday baseline results in estimates of SARF and ERF from a doubling of CO2 that are about 1% greater than the 1750 or 1850 values. The 1850 baseline is significant as it the reference pre-industrial state for CMIP6 experiments, including the abrupt4xCO2 and 1pctCO2 experiments used to estimate ECS and TCR from climate models. It should be noted that the 1pctCO2 experiment design relies on a logarithmic increase in CO2 SARF with concentration to estimate TCR, and both the Etminan et al. and Meinshausen et al. SARF formulas are super-logarithmic with increasing CO2 concentrations. Table 7.SM.2: Computed values of the SARF of a doubling of CO2 using the relationships in Etminan et al. and Meinshausen et al., and the ERF from a doubling of CO2, from different baseline concentrations of CO2 and N2O, and compared to SARF in AR5."}

The time-evolution of ERF is reported separately for CO2, CH4, N2O, other wellmixed greenhouse gases, ozone, stratospheric water vapour from methane oxidation, contrails and aviation-induced cirrus, aerosol-radiation interactions, aerosol-cloud interactions, light-absorbing particles on snow and ice, land-use change, volcanic, and solar. The contributions from 49 halogenated GHGs comprising the other well-mixed greenhouse gases category are further reported individually. Data is published in Annex III. For CO2, CH4 and N2O, the SARFs are calculated using time-dependent best-estimate concentrations of these gases from Chapter 2 using the formulae in Table 7.SM.1 and using concentrations from Chapter 2 in 1750 CE as baselines. Tropospheric adjustments of +5% for CO2, 14% for CH4 and +7 % are then added to these SARF values to produce ERF. For 49 halogenated greenhouse gases, concentration changes since 1750 are used combined with radiative efficiencies detailed in Table 7.SM.7 to derive SARF. Accounting for tropospheric adjustments adds +13% and +12% to CFC-11 and CFC-12 respectively when moving from SARF to ERF. No tropospheric adjustments are assumed for other halogenated species. For historical ozone forcing, the time series from 1750 to 2020 from Skeie et al. is adopted, using the multi-model mean ERF from six independent Earth System and chemistry-climate models that used CMIP6 precursor emissions and interactively calculated ozone burdens using full stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry schemes. From the original 12 models reporting results in Skeie et al., CNRM-CM6, CNRM-ESM2-1 and E3SM1-0 were excluded as they do not include full stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry, only the first out of the similar models CESM2-WACCM6 and CESM2-CAM6 were used, the input4MIPs forcing estimate was excluded as it did not use CMIP6 precursor emissions, and UKESM-1-0-LL was excluded for having implausible time evolutions of stratospheric ozone that resulted in negative total ozone ERF estimates for 2010 relative to 1850. The extrapolations for the 17501850 and 20102020 periods came from a single model and results were used up to and including 2019. Stratospheric water vapour from methane oxidation is treated a linear scaling of the methane ERF and scaled to the 17502019 assessment of 0.05 W m2. Several forcing categories are derived from global annual emissions totals of short-lived climate forcers. For the best estimate of historical emissions from 1750 to 2019, the 11 September 2020 version of the Community Emissions Data System is used, obtained from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4025316. CEDS provides emissions of black carbon, organic carbon, sulphur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and non-methane volatile organic compounds from the fossil fuel, industrial and agricultural sectors. Biomass burning emissions are used from the BB4CMIP dataset (also used for CMIP6 model integrations, from Van Marle et al.), aggregated into global annual totals.

Eq. was tuned to 11 CMIP6 models that provided historical time-varying ERFaci estimates and a parameter set of , sSO2 and sBC was obtained for each CMIP6 model. The parameter tunings from these 11 models were used to generate distributions using kernel density estimates from which 100,000 sample members were drawn and 100,000 candidate ERFaci time series were produced. The best estimate ERFaci time series is taken from the median of this 100,000-member ensemble, and then scaled to the assessed ERFaci of 1.0 W m2 for 1750 to 20052014. ERF from light-absorbing particles on snow is linear with BC emissions and scaled to the 1750-2019 ERF assessment of 0.08 W m2. ERF from land-use change is broken down into an albedo component and an irrigation component. The albedo component follows the historical ERF time series from Ghimire et al. from 1700 to 2005, and is extended forward to 2019 using cumulative land-use related CO2 emissions from the SSP Historical and SSP2-4.5 scenarios. This follows the treatment in Smith et al. and assumes that land-use related CO2 is closely related to deforestation and albedo change. The 1750-2019 assessment of 0.15 W m-2 is then applied to the time series. The ERF from irrigation, assessed to be 0.05 W m-2 for 17502019, scales with the albedo component. All anthropogenic components of the ERF described above are expressed relative to a 1750 baseline. Natural forcings comprise solar changes and volcanic eruptions. Volcanic ERF is derived from stratospheric aerosol optical depth using a conversion of 20  SAOD, or ERF = 20  SAOD + 0.2582 W m2 using absolute SAOD where SAOD is nominally taken at 550 nm wavelength. The SAOD conversion to ERF is expressed as an anomaly in SAOD relative to the 500 BCE to 1749 CE mean, so that the mean volcanic ERF for 500 BCE to 1749 CE is zero. This is in order that the long-term mean GSAT change from pre-industrial volcanic forcing alone is zero, avoiding a spurious cooling effect when applying the volcanic"}

FaIRv1.6.2 uses the two-layer model in Eq. as its core so converting its parameters to two-layer configurations is trivial. To convert MAGICC7.5.1's configuration to two-layer configurations, the two-layer model parameters are fitted to MAGICC7.5.1's output from an abrupt 2CO2 experiment. However, such a fitting procedure produces only an approximate translation because MAGICC7.5.1 is not well-represented by a two-timescale model. After these two conversions are done an ensemble of two-layer configurations is generated which is used for uncertainty analysis in GTP calculations. To generate the Chapter 6 two-layer configuration, the timescales and efficacy parameters are calculated as the average of FaIRv1.6.2's median and a fit to MAGICC7.5.1's median response. Response magnitudes that describe the contributions to the fast and slow response timescales are calculated such that the Chapter 6 configuration matches the best-estimate ECS of 3.0C and TCR of 1.8C under the best-estimate ERF due to a doubling of CO2 of 3.93 W m2.

In the tropics and in the extratropics of both hemispheres during summer/warm season, interannual variability of precipitation and runoff over land is projected to increase at a faster rate than changes in seasonal mean precipitation amount. It is very likely that rainfall variability related to the El NinoSouthern Oscillation will be amplified by the end of the 21st century. Sub-seasonal precipitation variability is also projected to increase, with fewer rainy days but increased daily mean precipitation intensity over many land regions. Precipitation extremes will increase in almost all regions, even where seasonal mean precipitation is projected to decrease. There is high confidence that heavy precipitation events associated with both tropical and extratropical cyclones will intensify. There are contrasting projections in monsoon precipitation, with increases in more regions than decreases. Summer monsoon precipitation is projected to increase for the South, Southeast and East Asian monsoon domains, while North American monsoon precipitation is projected to decrease. West African monsoon precipitation is projected to increase over the Central Sahel and decrease over the far western Sahel. There is low confidence in projected precipitation changes in the South American and Australian monsoons. There is high confidence that the monsoon season will be delayed in North and South America and medium confidence that it will be delayed in the Sahel. Precipitation associated with extratropical storms and atmospheric rivers will increase in the future in most regions. A continued poleward shift of storm tracks in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Pacific will lead to similar shifts in annual or seasonal precipitation. There is low confidence in projections of blocking and stationary waves and therefore their influence on precipitation for almost all regions. The seasonality of precipitation, water availability and streamflow will increase with global warming over the Amazon and in the subtropics, especially in the Mediterranean and southern Africa. The annual contrast between the wettest and driest month of the year is likely to increase by 35% per 1C in most monsoon regions in terms of precipitation, precipitation minus evaporation, and runoff. There is high confidence in an earlier onset in spring snowmelt, with higher peak flows at the expense of summer flows in snow-dominated regions globally, but medium confidence that reduced snow volume in lower-latitude regions will reduce runoff from snowmelt. Confidence in Projections, Non-Linear Responses and the Potential for Abrupt Changes Representation of key physical processes has improved in global climate models, but they are still limited in their ability to simulate all aspects of the present-day water cycle and to agree on future changes. Climate change studies benefit from sampling the full distribution of model outputs when considering future projections at regional scales. Increasing horizontal resolution in GCMs improves the representation of small-scale features and the statistics of daily precipitation. High-resolution climate and hydrological models provide a better representation of land surfaces, including topography, vegetation and land-use change, which improve the accuracy of simulations of regional changes in the water cycle. There is high confidence in the potential added value of regional climate models but only medium confidence that this potential is currently realized. Natural climate variability will continue to be a major source of uncertainty in near-term water cycle projections. Decadal predictions of water cycle changes should be considered with low confidence in most land areas because the internal variability of precipitation is difficult to predict and can offset or amplify the forced water cycle response. Water cycle changes that have already emerged from natural variability will become more pronounced in the near term, but the occurrence of volcanic eruptions can alter the water cycle for several years, decreasing global mean land precipitation and altering monsoon circulation. {8.5.2,"}

Terrestrial freshwater only represents about 1.8% of all water on Earth and the remainder is primarily made up of saline groundwater and saline lakes. Ice sheets, glaciers and snow pack account for approximately 97% of freshwater resources, with less than 3% of freshwater considered easily accessible and available for essential ecosystem functioning and human society's water resource needs. This very small fraction of freshwater represents a total volume of about 835 thousand km3, mostly contained in groundwater, the remaining 205 thousand km3 being stored in lakes, rivers, wetlands and soils. Although the natural cycling rate of this amount is theoretically enough to meet global human and ecosystem needs, there are large geographical and seasonal differences that influence the availability of freshwater to meet regional demands. Freshwater is the most essential natural resource on the planet and underpins almost all Sustainable Development Goals, which require access to adequate and safe resources for drinking and sanitation and many other purposes. Freshwater supports a range of human activities from irrigation to industrial processes including the generation of hydroelectricity and the cooling of thermoelectric power plants. These activities require sufficient quantities of freshwater that can be drawn from rivers, lakes, groundwater stores, and in some cases, desalinated sea water. Recent estimates of global water pools and fluxes suggest that half of global river discharge is redistributed each year by human water use. This emphasises the need to consider both anthropogenic climate change and direct human influences, such as population increase or migration, economic development, urbanization, and land use change, when planning water-related mitigation or adaptation strategies. Water scarcity occurs when there are insufficient freshwater resources to meet water demands, although water problems may also arise from water quality issues or from economic and institutional barriers. This affects the preservation of environmental flows that ultimately influence ecosystem functioning and services. As such, water availability is a major constraint on human societys ability to meet the future food and energy needs of a growing population. Water plays a key role in the production of energy, including hydroelectricity, bioenergy, and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels. These dependencies have resulted in increasing competition for water between the food and energy sectors. Pressures on this food-energy-water nexus are further compounded by increasing globalization, which can transfer large-scale water demands to other regions of the world, raising serious concerns about local food and water security in regions that are highly dependent on agricultural exports or imports. The consequences of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and human societies are primarily experienced through changes to the global water cycle. Changes in the quantity and seasonality of water due to climate change have long been recognized by IPCC and global development agencies as heavily influencing the food security and economic prosperity of many countries, particularly in the arid and semi-arid areas of the world including Asia, Africa, Australia, Latin America, the Mediterranean, and small island developing states. Having too much or too little water increases the likelihood of flooding and drought, as precipitation variability increases in a warming climate. Climate change poses a threat to both regional water availability and global water security. Changes in precipitation and glacier runoff and snowmelt influence other hydroclimate variables like surface and subsurface runoff, and groundwater recharge, which are critical to the water, food and energy security of many regions (Oki and Kanae, 2006; Jimenez Cisneros et al., 2014; Schewe et al., 2014; Mekonnen and"}

Globally, the frequency of intense precipitation events was projected to increase while the frequency of all precipitation events was projected to decrease, leading to the contradictory-seeming projection of a simultaneous increase in both droughts and floods. Surface evaporation change was projected to be positive over most of the ocean and to generally follow the pattern of precipitation change over land. Near-surface relative humidity reductions over many land areas were projected to be likely, with medium confidence. General decreases in soil moisture in present-day dry regions were considered likely, and projected with medium confidence under the RCP8.5 scenario. Soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, southwest USA and southern African regions was considered likely, with high confidence by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Projections for annual runoff included both decreases and increases. Decreases in Northern Hemisphere snow cover were assessed as very likely with continued global warming. As temperatures increase, snow accumulation was projected to begin later in the year and melting to start earlier, with related changes in snowmelt-driven river flows. In terms of the potential for abrupt change in components of the water cycle, long-term droughts and monsoonal circulation were identified as potentially undergoing rapid changes, but the assessment was reported with low confidence. 8.1.2.2 Key findings of AR6 special reports The SR1.5 assessed the impacts of global warming of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The dominant human influence on observed global warming and related water cycle changes was confirmed. Further evidence that anthropogenic global warming has caused an increase in the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation events at the global scale, as well as in drought occurrence in the Mediterranean region was also reported. Chapter 3 of SR1.5 highlights that each half degree of additional global warming influences the climate response. Heavy precipitation shows a global tendency to increase more at 2C compared to 1.5C, though there is low confidence in projected regional differences in heavy precipitation at 1.5C compared to 2C global warming, except at high latitudes or at high altitude where there is medium confidence. A key finding is that limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to 2C would approximately halve the proportion of the world population expected to suffer water scarcity, although there is considerable variability between regions. This is consistent with greater adverse impacts found at 2C compared to 1.5C for a number of dryness or drought indices. There is also medium confidence that land areas with increased runoff and exposure to flood hazards will increase more at 2C compared to 1.5C of global warming. The Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a changing Climate provides a comprehensive assessment of recent and projected changes, specifically in snow and ice-covered areas that form a key component of the water cycle in high-elevation and high-latitudes areas. High mountain regions have experienced significant warming since the early 20th century, resulting in reduced snowpack on average, with glaciers retreating globally since the mid-20th century. Glacier shrinkage and snow cover changes have led to changes in streamflow in many mountain regions in recent decades. Permafrost regions have undergone degradation and ground-ice loss due to recent warming. Glacier mass loss is projected to continue through the 21st century under all scenarios. In high mountain areas, low-elevation snow cover is also projected to decrease, regardless of emissions scenario. Widespread permafrost thaw is projected to continue through this century and beyond. River runoff in snowor glacier-fed basins is projected to increase in winter and to decrease in summer by 2100. In the oceans, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation will very likely weaken over the 21st century under all emissions scenarios, with potential effects on atmospheric circulation and the water cycle at the regional scale. The Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems has clear connections with the water cycle. This report indicates that since 1850-1900, land surface temperature has risen nearly twice as much as"}

A weaker circulation is required to reconcile global mean low-level water vapour increases with the smaller global precipitation responses of about 1-3% per oC. The slowdown can occur in both the Hadley and Walker circulations, but occurs preferentially in the Walker circulation in most climate models but this response has been questioned on the basis of model bias in east Pacific SST. Weakening is expected to drive P-E decreases over the western Pacific and increases over the eastern Pacific. However, the driving mechanisms for Walker circulation weakening differ to those involved in determining ENSO variability, so it is too simplistic to interpret changes as an El Nino pattern of regional hydrological cycle extremes. Internal variability is also capable of temporarily strengthening the Walker circulation(LHeureux et al., 2013; Chung et al., 2019) while regional responses depend on the pattern of warming. Model simulations show a stronger Pacific Walker circulation during the Last Glacial Maximum in response to a cooler climate, but a weaker Indian Ocean east-west circulation in response to the exposure of the Sunda and Sahul shelves due to lowered sea level. The latter effect is detectable in proxies for hydroclimate, as well as salinity and seasurface temperature. More relevant to future warming is the mid-Pliocene period, the last time the Earth experienced CO2 levels comparable to present. Sea surface temperature reconstructions show a weakening of the Pacific zonal gradient and a pattern of warmth consistent with a weaker Walker cycle response. Although the Pliocene SST pattern and wet subtropics contrast with present conditions, the paleoclimate record strengthens evidence that a warmer climate is associated with a weaker Walker circulation. Since AR5, weakening of the tropical circulation has been explained as a rapid response to increasing CO2 concentrations and slower response to warming and evolving SST patterns. Large-scale tropical circulation weakens by 3-4% in a rapid response to a quadrupling of CO2 concentrations, which suppresses tropospheric radiative cooling, particularly in sub-tropical ocean subsidence regions. The resulting increased atmospheric stability explains the rapid weakening of the Walker circulation and Northern Hemisphere Hadley Cell. Subsequent surface warming contributes up to a 12% slowing of circulation for a uniform 4oC SST increase, driven by thermodynamic decreases in temperature lapse rate. The regional Intertropical Convergence Zone position, width and strength determine the location and seasonality of the tropical rain belt. Since AR5, multiple studies have linked cross-equatorial energy transport to the mean ITCZ position. Multi-model studies agree that aerosol cooling in the Northern Hemisphere led to a southward shift in the ITCZ and tropical precipitation after the 1950s up to the 1980s that is linked with the 1980s Sahel drought. In particular, aerosol-cloud interaction was identified as a potentially important driver of this shift but this is uncertain since observations suggest that models may overestimate or underestimate the aerosol cloud-mediated cooling effects. In addition, greenhouse gas forcing has been invoked in explaining much of the increase in Sahel precipitation since the 1980s through enhanced meridional temperature gradient, with only a secondary role for aerosol. Understanding of how ITCZ width and strength respond to a warming climate has improved since AR5. Studies suggest that convection gets stronger and more focused within the core of the ITCZ. This leads to drying on the equatorward edges of the ITCZ and a moistening tendency in the ITCZ core. Feedbacks involving clouds have been identified as an important mechanism leading to tightening and strengthening of the ITCZ (Popp and Silvers,"}

Stronger ascent in the core amplifies the wet get wetter response while reduced moisture inflow near the ITCZ edges reduces this response below the 7% per oC thermodynamic increase in moisture transport. Thus, there is a range of evidence and medium agreement for strengthening and contraction of the ITCZ with warming that sharpens contrasts between wet and dry regimes. However, understanding of how the regional ITCZ location responds in a warming climate is not robust with limited evidence of distinct regional responses to GHG forcing including a northward shift over eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean and a southward shift in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Paleoclimate evidence highlights the distinct regional ITCZ responses to hemispheric asymmetry in volcanic and orbital forcing and rapid shifts in the ITCZ and regional monsoons in response to AMOC collapse cannot be ruled out. Monsoons are key components of the tropical overturning circulation that can be understood as a balance between net energy input and the export of moist static energy. This is determined by contrasting surface heat capacity between ocean and land and modified through changes in atmospheric dynamics, tropical tropospheric stability and land surface properties. Thermodynamic increases in moisture transport are expected to increase monsoon strength and area. Since AR5, evidence continues to demonstrate that monsoon circulation is sensitive to spatially varying radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosols and GHGs. Changes in SST patterns also play a role by altering cross-equatorial energy transports and landocean temperature contrasts. This evidence continues to support a thermodynamic strengthening of monsoon precipitation that is partly offset by slowing of the tropical circulation but with weak evidence and low agreement for regional aspects of circulation changes. Disagreement between paleo-climate and modern observations, physical theory and numerical simulations of global monsoons have been partly reconciled through improved understanding of regional processes, although interpreting past changes in the context of future projections requires careful account of differing forcings and feedbacks. Assessment of past changes and future projections in regional monsoons are provided in Sections 2.3.1.4.2, 8.3.2.4 and 8.4.2.4. Since AR5, understanding of poleward expansion of the Hadley Cells has improved but its role in subtropical drying is limited to the zonal mean and dominated by ocean regions. Over subtropical land, evolving SST patterns and land-ocean warming contrasts, that are partly explained by rapid responses to CO2 increases, can dominate aspects of the atmospheric circulation response and resultant regional water cycle changes, particularly for projected drying in semi-arid, winter-rainfall dominated sub-tropical climates. Poleward expansion of the tropical belt is expected to drive a corresponding shift in mid-latitude storm tracks, but the controlling mechanisms differ between hemispheres. Southern Hemisphere expansion is driven by GHG forcing and amplified by stratospheric ozone depletion, while weaker Northern Hemisphere expansion in response to GHG forcing is modulated by tropospheric ozone and aerosol forcing, particularly black carbon. However, internal variability is found to dominate observed responses in the Northern Hemisphere, precluding attribution to radiative forcing. Paleoclimate evidence of poleward expansion and weakening of westerly winds in both hemispheres in the warmer Pliocene is linked to reduced equator to pole thermal gradients and ice volume. The influence of amplified Arctic warming on mid-latitude regional water cycles is not well understood based on simple physical grounds due to the large number of competing physical processes. The thermal gradient between polar and lower latitude regions decreases at low levels due to Arctic warming amplification. However, at higher altitudes, the corresponding thermal gradient increases with warming due to cooling of the Arctic stratosphere and this is consistent with a strengthening of the"}

Changes in the strength of the polar stratospheric vortex can also alter the midlatitude circulation in winter, but responses are not consistent across models. Nevertheless, thermodynamic strengthening of moisture convergence into weather systems and polar regions is robust and remains valid despite weak understanding of atmospheric circulation change. In summary, there is high confidence that altered atmospheric wind patterns in response to radiative forcing and evolving surface temperature patterns will affect the regional water cycle in most regions. Mean tropical circulation is expected to slow with global warming but temporary multi-decadal strengthening is possible due to internal variability. Slowing of the tropical circulation reduces the meridional P-E gradient over the Pacific and can partly offset thermodynamic amplification of PE patterns and strengthening of monsoons but regional characteristics of tropical rain belt changes are not well understood.

Since AR5, evidence from multiple locations shows that intrusions of warm, moist air are important in controlling glacier mass balance, the likelihood of extreme ablation or snowfall events depending on air temperature. Sensible heating from warm air and increased longwave radiation from atmospheric moisture and low clouds drive melt events. Reductions in snow, freshwater ice and permafrost affect terrestrial hydrology. Permafrost degradation reduces soil ice and alters the extent of thermokarst lake coverage (Section 9.5.2; SROCC). A lag between current climate change and permafrost degradation is expected, given the slow response rates in frozen ground and the fact that snow cover insulates soil from sensible heat exchanges with the air above. Postwildfire areas are also linked with permafrost degradation in the Arctic based on satellite observations. An increase in spring rainfall can increase heat advection by infiltration, exacerbating permafrost thaw and leading to increased methane emissions. Increased heat transport by Arctic rivers can also contribute to earlier sea ice melt. In summary, it is virtually certain that warming will cause a loss of frozen water stores, except in areas where temperatures remain below 0oC for most of the year. There is high confidence that warming and reduced snow volume drives an earlier snowmelt, leading to seasonally dependent changes in streamflow. There is medium confidence that weaker sunlight earlier in the season can reduce the rate of snowmelt. Melting of snowpack or glaciers can increase stream flow in high latitude and high-altitude catchments until frozen water reserves are depleted. There is high confidence that warm, moist airflows and associated precipitation dominate glacier mass balance in some regions. 8.2.3.2 Processes determining heavy precipitation and flooding Evidence that heavy precipitation events intensify as the planet warms has strengthened since AR5 based on improved physical understanding, extensive modelling and increasing observational corroboration. There is robust evidence, with medium agreement across a range of modelling and observational studies, of thermodynamic intensification of wet seasons. Extreme daily precipitation is expected to increase at close to the 7%/oC increase in the near-surface atmospheric moisture holding capacity determined by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, with limited evidence that higher rates apply for shorter duration precipitation events. However, observed estimates sample multiple synoptic weather states, mixing thermodynamic and dynamic factors, so are not directly relatable to climate change responses. The contrasting spatial scales sampled by the observations and models explain the large range of daily and sub-daily precipitation scaling with temperature assessed in Figure 8.4.

Drought severity also depends on human activities and decision-making. Societies have developed a variety of strategies to manipulate the water cycle to increase resiliency in the face of water scarcity, including irrigation, creation of artificial reservoirs, and groundwater pumping. While potentially buffering water resource capacity, in some cases these interventions may unexpectedly increase vulnerability. For example, while increased irrigation efficiency may ensure more water is available to crops, the corresponding reduction in runoff and subsurface recharge may exacerbate hydrologic drought. Furthermore, while building dams and increasing surface reservoir capacity can boost water resources, they may actually increase drought vulnerability if demands rise to take advantage of the increased supply or if over-reliance on these surface reservoirs is encouraged. Interactions between adaptation, vulnerability, and drought impacts are discussed further in WGII. In summary, there is high confidence that a warming climate drives an increase in atmospheric evaporative demand, decreasing available soil moisture. There is high confidence that higher atmospheric CO2 increases plant water-use efficiency, but low confidence that this physiological effect can counterbalance water losses. Since drought can be defined in a number of ways, there are potentially different responses under a warming climate depending on drought type. Beyond a lack of precipitation, changes in evapotranspiration are critical components of drought, because these can lead to soil moisture declines. Under very dry soil conditions, evapotranspiration becomes restricted and plants experience water stress in response to increased atmospheric demand. Human activities and decision-making have a critical impact on drought severity."}

The dashed and solid blue lines correspond to the vertical temperature profiles in the absence and presence of the absorbing aerosol layer, respectively, and the solid and dashed red lines denote the dry and moist adiabats, respectively. Absorbing aerosols result in an increasing temperature in the atmosphere but a reduced temperature at the surface. The reduced surface temperature and the increased temperature aloft lead to a larger negative energy associated with convective inhibition and a higher convection condensation level under the polluted conditions. On the other hand, the absorbing aerosol layer induces a larger convective available potential energy above CCL, facilitating more intensive vertical development of clouds, if lifting is sufficient to overcome the larger convective inhibition. From. Aerosol cloud microphysical effects Cloud droplets nucleate on pre-existing aerosol particles which act as cloud condensation nuclei. Anthropogenic aerosols add CCN, compared to a pristine background, and produce clouds with more numerous and smaller droplets, slower to coalesce into raindrops and to freeze into ice hydrometeors at temperatures below 0C. Adding CCN suppresses light rainfall from shallow and short-lived clouds, but it is compensated by heavier rainfall from deep clouds. Adding aerosols to clouds in extremely clean air invigorates them by more efficient vapour condensation on the added drop surfaces. Clouds forming in more polluted air masses need to grow deeper to initiate rain. This leads to larger amount of cloud water evaporating aloft while cooling and moistening the air there at the expense of the lower levels, which leads to convective invigoration, followed by convergence, air mass destabilization and added rainfall in an amplifying feedback loop. In addition, delaying rain initiation until greater altitudes are reached transports more cloud water above the 0C altitude and leads to additional release of latent heat of freezing and/or vapour deposition, which in combination with the added latent heat of condensation enhances the cloud updrafts. The stronger updrafts invigorate mixed phase precipitation and the resultant hail and cloud electrification. This includes the outer convective rainbands of tropical cyclones and there is medium confidence that air pollution enhances flood hazard associated with the outer rain bands at the expense of the inner rain bands. The aerosol effect on invigoration and rainfall from deep convective clouds peaks at moderate levels, but reverses into suppression with more aerosols. More generally, the microphysical aerosol-related processes often compensate or buffer each other. For example, suppressed rain by slowing drop coalescence enhances mixed phase precipitation. Therefore, despite the potentially large aerosol influence on the precipitation forming processes, the net outcome of aerosol microphysical effects on precipitation amount has generally low confidence, especially when evaluated with respect to the background of high natural variability in precipitation. Ice nucleating particles aerosols initiate ice precipitation from persistent supercooled water clouds that have cloud droplets too small for efficient warm rain, or expedite mixed phase precipitation in short lived supercooled rain clouds. Most INP are desert and soil dust particles, rather than air pollution aerosols. Biogenic particles from terrestrial and marine origin are more rare, but important at temperatures above about -15C. Dust particles from long-range transport across the Pacific were found to enhance snow forming processes over the Sierra Nevada in California. The impact of INP was demonstrated by"}

Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global, near-universal retreat of glaciers since the 1990s. In Table 9.5, the contribution of glaciers to sea level rise for different periods is presented; in 1971-2018 glacier mass loss contributed 20.9 mm or 22.1% of the sea level rise during that period. The highest mass loss rates are observed in the southern Andes, New Zealand, Alaska, Central Europe and Iceland while the largest mass loss are observed in Alaska, the periphery of Greenland and Arctic Canada. Predominantly, runoff from small glaciers such as in Canada has decreased because of glacier mass loss, while runoff from larger glaciers such as Alaska has typically increased. Asia contains the largest concentration of glaciers outside the polar regions where the total glacier mass change is 16.3  3.5 Gt/yr over 2000-2016 with considerable intra-regional variability.

In AR6, Chapter 2 states that the HC has very likely widened and strengthened since at least the 1980s, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. The poleward shift of the HC is closely related to migration of the location of tropical cyclone trajectories in both hemispheres, with a very likely poleward shift over the western North Pacific Oceans since the 1940s. Moreover, the Western North Pacific Subtropical High has extended westward since the 1970s, resulting in a monsoon rain band shift over China, with excessive rainfall along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley along ~ 30N over eastern China. At the same time, the effect of anthropogenic aerosols dominated the response to GHG increases over East Asia, resulting in a weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon and causing a drying trend in northeastern China and northern parts of South Asia. During 19772007, the precipitation variability over the eastern United States increased due to changes in the intensity and position of the western ridge of the North Atlantic Subtropical High. In the Southern Hemisphere, the HC expansion has been associated with both the intensification and poleward shift of the subtropical high pressure belt, with consequences for precipitation amount over Africa, Australia, South America, and subtropical Pacific islands. The subtropical ridge in Australia has intensified significantly since 1970, with marked declines observed in April to October rainfall across southeastern and southwestern Australia. The local tropical edges of the meridional overturning cells are more closely associated with hydroclimate variations than the subtropical ridge. Poleward expansion of the tropical belt strongly contributes to precipitation decline in the poleward edge of the subtropics, although recent modelling evidence suggests that subtropical precipitation declines are a response to direct CO2 radiative forcing mainly over ocean, irrespective of the HC expansion. Both reanalyses datasets and climate model simulations suggest that the HC expansion is not associated with widespread, zonally symmetric subtropical drying over land. Since AR5, an improved understanding of the key drivers of the recent HC expansion has been achieved, identifying the role of both internal variability and anthropogenic climate change. Part of the recent expansion of the HC has been driven by a swing from warm to cold phase of the Pacific Decadal Variability. The presence of large multidecadal variability in 20th century reanalyses means there is limited evidence on the human influence on the recent HC strengthening, yet the southward shift of the southern edge and widening of the Southern Hemisphere HC appeared as robust features in all reanalysis datasets, and their trends have accelerated during 1979-2010. As assessed in Section 3.3.3.1, GHG increases and stratospheric ozone depletion have contributed to the expansion of the zonal mean HC in the Southern Hemisphere since around 1980, and the expansion of the Northern Hemisphere HC has not exceeded the range of internal variability. Moreover, Antarctic ozone depletion can cause a poleward shift in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude jet and HC. Further assessment of the attribution of recently observed changes in the HC extent and intensity is found in Section 3.3.3.1. In summary, it is very likely that the recent Hadley Circulation expansion was associated with poleward shifts of tropical cyclone tracks over the western North Pacific Ocean since the 1940s, and of extratropical storm tracks in the Southern Hemisphere since the 1970s. Changes to the HC in the Northern Hemisphere may have contributed to subtropical drying and a poleward expansion of aridity during the boreal summer, but there is low confidence due to limited evidence.

The observed trends in the WC since 1980 are consistent with a very likely WC strengthening in the Pacific, similar to a La Nina pattern, with medium confidence in the magnitude of these changes due to differences between satellite observations and reanalyses. The causes of the observed strengthening of the Pacific WC during 1980-2014 are not well understood due to competing influences from individual external forcings and since this strengthening is outside the range of variability simulated in coupled models, as assessed in Chapter 3. Recent strengthening in the WC has been linked with internal variability, although one study argues that it could be a response forced by GHG that models do not capture because of common SST biases in the equatorial Pacific. It could be also related to an interbasin thermostat mechanism whereby the human-induced Indian Ocean warming emerged earlier than in the tropical Pacific and induced a transient strengthening of the zonal sea level pressure gradient and easterly trades in the tropical Pacific. The weakening of the WC observed during most of the 20th century is associated with reductions in land rainfall over the Maritime Continent during 1950-1999. In contrast, the recent strengthening of the WC has been associated with an intensification of extreme flooding and an increased frequency of wet days over the northwestern Amazon, increased precipitation in South America, reduced precipitation over eastern Africa, and increased rainfall in southern Africa. Internal variability has been shown to have a dominant role in the recent strengthening of the WC. In summary, there is high confidence that changes in the Pacific Walker Circulation are associated with changes in the water cycle over regions like the Maritime Continent, South America and Africa. It is very likely that the WC has strengthened in the Pacific since the 1980s, with medium confidence that this strengthening is within the range of internal variability. 8.3.2.4 Monsoons AR5 reported low confidence in the attribution of changes in monsoons to human influences, although a detailed attribution assessment of the observed changes in the regional monsoons was not presented. Large human populations in the monsoon regions of the world heavily depend on freshwater supply for agriculture, water resources, industry, transport and various socio-economic activities. The effects of GHG forcing combined with water vapour feedback and cloud feedbacks are fundamental to monsoon precipitation changes in a warming world. Since AR5 there has been improved understanding of precipitation changes associated with regional monsoons. Sections 2.3.1.4.2 and 3.3.3.2 provide an assessment of observed changes and attribution for the global monsoon. Here we provide an assessment of the observed changes in regional monsoons and underlying causes. In AR6, the definition of regional monsoons slightly differs from AR5 and the rationale for it is provided in Annex V. Specific examples of regional monsoons are discussed further in section 10.4.2, from the perspective of climate change attribution and in section 10.6.3, from the viewpoint of"}

Since AR5, several studies have documented long-term variations and changes in the South and Southeast Asian Summer Monsoon rainfall. The SAsiaM strengthened during past periods of enhanced summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere, such as the early-to-mid Holocene warm period around 9000 to 6000 years BP and weakened during cold periods, such as the Last Glacial Maximum and Younger Dryas. These long time-scale changes in monsoon intensity are tightly linked to orbital forcing and changes in highlatitude climate.

Nevertheless, the detection of century-long decreases in regional monsoon rainfall is obscured by the presence of multidecadal time-scale precipitation variations which are evident in long-term rain guage records extending back to the early 1800s and emerge in long-term climate simulations. A significant decline in summer monsoon precipitation is observed over India since the mid-20th century, which is accompanied by a weakening of the large-scale monsoon circulation. This precipitation decline is corroborated by a decreasing trend in the frequency of monsoon depressions that form over Bay of Bengal, an increasing trend in the frequency and duration of monsoon breaks or dry spells, significant decreases in soil moisture and increases in drought severity across different parts of India post-"}

While recent studies have reported an apparent recovery of the Indian summer monsoon over a relatively short period since 2003, long-term trends for the period 1951-2015 indicate an overall decrease in the regional monsoon precipitation. A case study on the Indian summer monsoon is provided in Section 10.6.3. Evidence from several climate modelling studies indicates that the observed decrease in the regional monsoon precipitation during the second half of the 20th century is dominated by the radiative effects of Northern Hemisphere anthropogenic aerosols, with smaller contributions due to volcanic aerosols from the Mount Pinatubo and El Chichon eruptions. Land-use changes over South and Southeast Asia and the rapid warming trend of the equatorial Indian Ocean during the recent few decades also appear to have contributed to the observed decrease in monsoon precipitation. Overall, the magnitude of the precipitation response to anthropogenic forcing exhibits large spread across CMIP5 models pointing to the strong internal variability of the regional monsoon, including variations linked to phase changes of the Pacific interdecadal variability, uncertainties in representing aerosol-cloud interactions, and the effects of local versus remote aerosol forcing. CMIP3 and CMIP5 models do not accurately reproduce the observed seasonal cycle of precipitation over the major river basins of South and Southeast Asia, limiting the attribution of observed regional hydroclimatic changes. While warm rain processes and organized convection are known to dominate the heavy orographic monsoon rainfall over the Western Ghats mountains, in various parts of India and East Asia, there are uncertainties in representing the regional physical processes of the monsoon environment, including cloud-aerosol interactions, land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere coupling, in state-of-the-art climate models. In summary, there is high confidence in observational evidence for a weakening of the SAsiaM in the second half of the 20th century. Results from climate models indicate that anthropogenic aerosol forcing has dominated the recent decrease in summer monsoon precipitation, as opposed to the expected intensification due to GHG forcing. On paleoclimate timescales, the SAsiaM strengthened in response to enhanced summer warming in the NH during the early-to-mid Holocene, while it weakened during cold intervals. These changes are tightly linked to orbital forcing and changes in high-latitude climate. 8.3.2.4.2 East Asian Monsoon"}

Similarly, Pliocene reconstructions indicate stronger intensity of the EAsiaM with a more northward penetration of the monsoon rain belt. EAsiaM variability has been related to AMOC dynamics, especially during the last glacial period, but whether the relationship is negative or positive remains uncertain.

Despite improvements in model simulations of the present-day monsoons, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models underestimate mid-Holocene changes in the amount and spatial extent of the WAfriM precipitation. During the recent past, long-term rain gauge observations display substantial variability in the WAfriM precipitation over the 20th century. The WAfriM experienced the wettest decade of the 20th century during the 1950s and early 1960s, over much of the western and central Sahel region, followed abruptly by the driest years during 1970-1989. The percentage deficit in the annual rainfall during 1970-1989, relative to the longterm mean, ranged from 60% in the north of Sahel to 25-30% in the south. The long decline in annual rainfall is related to a decrease of rain occurrence over the Sahel and the Soudano-Guinean sub-region of WestAfrica, even though the interannual variability pattern is more complex. Decrease of rainfall occurrences resulted from decreases in large convective events in the core of the rainy season, that modulate interannual variability of the WAfriM.

During 1948-2010, trends of boreal summer precipitation amount were significantly positive over New Mexico and the core NAmerM region, but significantly negative over southwestern Mexico. In addition, diverse datasets like CRU, CHIRPS and GPCP show significant decreases of precipitation in parts of the southwest United States and northwestern Mexico, including the NAmerM region. Other studies suggest a strengthening of the NAmerM upper level anticyclone since the mid-1970s, with a more frequent northward location. Between 1910-2010, the number of precipitation events increased across the northern Chihuahuan desert, within the NAmerM domain, despite a decrease in their magnitude, and the length of extreme dry and wet periods also increased. An increase in intense rainfall and severe weather events has been observed in several locations, especially in southwestern Arizona since 1991, resulting from increases in atmospheric moisture content and instability; a change that has been confirmed by convective-permitting model simulations. A dense network of 59 rain gauges located in southeastern Arizona suggests an intensification of monsoon sub-daily rainfall since the mid-1970s, as expected by a stronger global warming signature for sub-daily rather than daily or monthly precipitation accumulation. Section 10.4.2.3 provides further details on changes in precipitation in southwestern North America. Evidence from multiple reanalyses suggests that increases in NAmerM rainfall have contributed to the increasing trend of global monsoon precipitation. In addition, more frequent occurrence of earlier retreats of the NAmerM since 1979 is documented, in association with the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and a westward expansion of the North Atlantic Subtropical High. Analyses from a 50-km resolution GCM indicate that the NAmerM response to CO2 is very sensitive to SST biases, showing reductions in summer NAmerM precipitation with increased CO2 when the SST biases are small in contrast to CMIP5 models. The NAmerM has been shown to be also sensitive to SO2 emissions. In summary, both paleoclimate evidence and observations indicate an intensification of the NAmerM in a warmer climate. The intensification recorded since about the 1970s has been partly driven by GHG emissions. 8.3.2.4.5 South American Monsoon"}

This could be partly due to a reduction in the zonal SST gradient of the Pacific Ocean, favouring El Nino-like conditions. Other studies suggest increased SAmerM precipitation amount during the Late Holocene, in association with the expansion of the tropical forest. Well-dated equilibrium lines of glaciers during the deglaciation suggest that the AMOC enhances Atlantic moisture sources and precipitation amount increase over the tropical and southern Andes. Observations during 1979-2014 suggest that poleward shifts in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone noted in recent decades, are associated with precipitation amount decrease along the equatorward margin and increase along the poleward margin of the convergenze zone. Several observational studies identified delayed onsets of the SAmerM after 1978 related to longer dry seasons in the southern Amazon. In contrast, other studies indicate a trend toward earlier onsets of the SAmerM. These discrepancies are explained by the methodology used and the domain considered for the SAmerM, confirming the occurrence of delayed onsets of the SAmerM since 1978. CMIP5 simulations show trends toward delayed onsets of the SAmerM in association with anthropogenic forcing, although the simulated trends underestimate the observed trends. Total rainfall reductions are observed in the southern Amazon during September-October-November after 1978, consistent with reductions in river discharge in the region. Significant increases in precipitation have been observed over southeastern Brazil during 1902-2005 while non-significant decreases have been found over central Brazil. In Bolivia, increases were observed during 1965-1984, while reductions have occurred since then. However, the Peruvian Amazon does not reveal significant changes in mean rainfall during 19652007. Historical simulations from CMIP5 ensembles adequately capture the observed summer precipitation amount over central and southeastern Brazil, thereby providing high confidence in interpreting the observed variability of SAmerM for the period 1960-1999. Also, CMIP5 simulations indicate that the anthropogenic forcing associated with increased GHG emissions is necessary to explain the positive trends in upper-troposphere zonal winds observed over the South American Altiplano. However, the detection of anthropogenically-induced signals for precipitation is still ambiguous in monsoon regions, like the SAmerM. In summary, there is high confidence that the SAmerM onset has been delayed since the late 1970s. This is reproduced by CMIP5 simulations that consider anthropogenic forcing. There is also high confidence that precipitation during the dry-to-wet transition season has been reduced over the southern Amazon. Paleoclimate reconstructions and simulations suggest a weaker SAmerM during warmer epochs such as the Mid-Holocene or the 900-1100 period, and stronger monsoon during colder epochs such as the LGM or the 1400-1600 period. 8.3.2.4.6 Australian and Maritime Continent Monsoon"}

There is no consensus on the cause of the observed Australian monsoon rainfall trends, with some studies suggesting changes are due to altered circulation driving increased moisture transport or increased frequency of the wettest synoptic regimes. Other studies find that model simulations that include anthopogenic aerosols are better able to capture observed Australian monsoon rainfall trends than simulations with natural or GHG forcing only. The Maritime Continent experiences the influence of both the Asian and the Australian monsoons, with rainfall peaking during boreal winter/austral summer. Reductions in land rainfall and marine cloudiness over the MC and weakening of surface moisture flux convergence have been observed in the period 1950-1999. These trends are indicative of a slowdown of the Walker Circulation, with positive sea level pressure trends over the MC and negative trends over the central equatorial Pacific. More recently, a trend of increasing annual rainfall over large areas of the MC has been identified. Given the large variability in MC rainfall on interannual time scales, the choice of time period may influence the calculated rainfall trend. During 1951-2007 daily rainfall extremes did not increase over the MC, in contrast to the rest of Southeast Asia. Rainfall extremes in Indonesia increased in austral summer, as evidenced from station weather observations for the period 1983-2012. In summary, notable rainfall increases have been observed in parts of northern Australia since the 1970s, although there is low confidence in the human contribution to these changes. Rainfall changes have been observed over the MC region but there is low confidence in the identification of trends because of large variability at interannual timescales. 8.3.2.5 Tropical cyclones AR5 assessed low confidence in centennial changes in tropical cyclone activity globally, and in the attribution of observed changes in TCs to anthropogenic forcing. Since AR5, there has been considerable progress in understanding the observed changes of TCs and an overall improved knowledge of the sensitivity of TCs to both GHG and aerosol forcing. There is medium confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to observed heavy rainfall events over the United States associated with TCs and other regions with sufficient data coverage. There has been increased frequency of TC heavyrainfall events over several areas in the United States since the late 19th century that is greater than what would be expected solely from changes in U.S. landfall frequency, suggesting the increasing role of TCs have in causing heavy-rainfall events. For example, there is evidence for an anthropogenic contribution to the extreme rainfall of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. While TCs cause extreme local rainfall and flooding, they can be also an important contributor to annual precipitation and regional fresh water resources. Transport of moisture by TCs is an important contributor for precipitation over the coastal areas of East Asia mostly from July through October, with the TC rainfall accounting for nearly 10% to 30% of the total rainfall in the region. Local TC rainfall totals depend on rain-rate and translation speed with slow TCs such as Hurricane Harvey, providing a clear example of the effect of slow translation speed on local rainfall accumulation, with urbanization exacerbating the storm total rainfall and flooding. In addition to evidence that rain-rates have increased, there is evidence that TC translation speed has slowed globally thus amplifying thermodynamic intensification of rainfall and may be linked to anthropogenic forcing. This is limited evidence however, so there is medium confidence"}

Atmospheric rviers were not assessed in AR5. ARs are associated with atmospheric moisture transport from the tropics to the mid and high latitudes, although the drivers of moisture transport relative to the different airstreams within extratropical cyclones remains a subject of current study. While much previous research has focused on the west coast of North America, ARs occur throughout extratropical and polar regions and are often associated with locally-heavy precipitation, including a substantial fraction of all midlatitude extreme precipitation events. ARs also affect East Asia strongly during the period from late spring to summer. ARs can be related to warming/melt events trough the intrusions of warm and moist air in Antarctica, Greenland and New Zealand, contributing about 45-60% of total annual precipitation in subtropical South America. They also transport moisture from South America to the western and central South Atlantic, feeding the ARs that reach the west coast of South Africa. However, the estimation of precipitation rate from ARs can have large uncertainties, especially as ARs hit topographically complex coastal regions, which can cause complexities in quantifying AR-related precipitation. Analysis of observed trends in the characteristics of ARs has been limited. and have shown a rising trend in land-falling AR activity over the west coast of North American since 1948. have also documented a seasonally-asymmetric warming of ARs affecting the United States West Coast since 1980, which has hydrological implications for the timing and magnitude of regional runoff. Longer-term paleoclimate analysis of ARs is even more limited, although Lora et al. reported that in the last glacial maximum, AR landfalls over the North America west coast were shifted southward compared to the present conditions. In summary, it is likely that there was an increasing trend in the AR activity in the eastern North Pacific since the mid-20th century. However, there is low confidence in the magnitude of this trend and no formal attribution, although such an increase in activity is consistent with the expected and observed increase in precipitable water associated with human-induced global warming. 8.3.2.9 Modes of climate variability and regional teleconnections"}

ENSO influences precipitation and evaporation dynamics, river flow and flooding at a global scale. Reconstruction of Thailands Chao Praya River peak season streamflow displays a strong correlation with ENSO. Based on water storage estimates from 2002 to 2015, drought conditions over the Yangtze River basin followed La Nina events and flood conditions followed El Nino events. Strong correlation between ENSO and terrestrial water storage has been identified mostly in the subtropics but with diverse intensities and timelags depending on the region. The likelihood of increased/decreased flood hazard during ENSO events has a complex spatial pattern with large uncertainties. Tropical SSTs and associated global circulation may increase rainfall in West Africa, as observed in some years during 1950-2015, despite the presence of El Nino. During an El Nino summer, equatorial convective systems and the associated Walker circulation tend to shift eastward, leading to decreases in Indian summer monsoon rainfall. This teleconnection is modulated by Indian Ocean variability, as observed during the extreme positive IOD event in 2019. Since the end of the 19th century, synchronous hydroclimate changes have been identified over south eastern Australia and South Africa modulated by ENSO, as well as other regional fluctuations like the Botswana High over Southern Africa. Over southern South America, the ENSO influence on precipitation interacts with the influence of SAM, exhibiting large multi-decadal variations because of changes in the correlation between the two large-scale modes. Other processes underlying ENSO teleconnections of relevance for water cycle changes include water vapour and moisture transports, like over the Middle East, southeastern China, or central Asia, southeastern South America, Australia and southern United States. There is no evidence of trend in the Indian Ocean Dipole mode and associated anthropogenic forcing. AR5 concluded that the IOD is likely to remain active, affecting climate extremes in Australia, Indonesia and east Africa. Since the AR5, IOD teleconnections have been identified extending further to the Middle East, to the Yangtze river, where in boreal summer and autumn positive IOD events tend to increase the precipitation in the southeastern and central part of the basin, and to the southern Africa extreme wet seasons. During the last millenium, the combined effect of a positive IOD and El Nino conditions have caused severe droughts over Australia. In the satellited period, it is found more effective in inducing significant decrease of rainfall over Indonesia, with the opposite occurring for negative IOD events. Similarly, over the Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins major droughts have been recorded during co-occurring El Nino and positive IOD, while floods occurred during La Nina and negative IOD conditions. Over equatorial East Africa the IOD affects the short rain season exacerbating flooding and inundations independently of ENSO. Extreme conditions, like 2019 Australian bushfires and African flooding, have been associated with strong positive IOD conditions.

Since AR5, studies on MJO teleconnections within the tropics and from the tropics to higher latitudes have continued. The strength and frequency of the MJO have increased over the past century because of global warming. A 20th century reconstruction suggests a 13% increase of the MJO amplitude, with differences in seasonal variability. However, up to half of changes recorded during the second half of the 20th century could be due to internal variability. Other observed changes in MJO characteristics include a decrease in the residence time over the Indian Ocean but an increase over the Indo-Pacific and Maritime Continent sectors. Consequences of these changes are increased rainfall over Southeast Asia, northern Australia, southwest Africa and the Amazon, and drying over the west coast of the United States and Equador. During the austral summer, air-sea interactions and location of the MJO active phase are important to modulate the strength of the rainfall response in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone, including its southward shift. In the austral winter, the intraseasonal variability is mostly influential over regions of the Amazon Basin. Some MJO phases are particularly effective in conjuction with tropical cyclones in enhancing westerly moisture fluxes toward east Africa. Simulated changes in MJO precipitation amplitude are extremely sensitive to the pattern of SST warming and ocean-atmosphere coupling. In agreement with results from previous model generations, most CMIP5 models still underestimate MJO amplitude, and struggle to generate a coherent eastward propagation of precipitation and wind, affecting regional surface climate in the tropics and extra-tropics. In addition, most CMIP5 models simulate an MJO that propagates faster compared with observations, with a poorly represented intra-seasonal precipitation variability. Over the Indian Ocean, the propagation speed of convection in some CMIP5 models tends to be slower than observed due to a strong persistence of equatorial precipitation. Among other processes, improving the moisture-convection coupling, the representation of moist convection, the interaction between lower tropospheric heating and boundary layer convergence, and the topography of the Maritime Continent improve simulations of the MJO. In fact, CMIP6 models reproduce the amplitude and propagation of the MJO better than CMIP5 models due to increased horizontal moisture advection over the Maritime Continent. Despite the diverse theories of MJO evolution and processes that have been developed since its discovery, a better understanding of its dynamics is still needed. Furthermore, metrics based on dynamical processes are needed to assess model simulations of these events as well as related teleconnections. In summary, multiple water cycle changes related to ENSO and IOD teleconnections have been observed across the 20th century, mostly dominated by interannual to multi-decadal variations.

Reduced winter precipitation is well correlated with the NAO over Southern Europe and Mediterranean countries. NAO teleconnections in those regions include influences on groundwater and streamflow. Remote teleconnections of the NAO have been identified over Northern China, the Yangtze River valley and India. The summer phase of the NAO is significantly correlated with variations in summer rainfall in East China, with the thermal forcing of the Tibetan Plateau providing a link to this Eurasian teleconnection. In the Southern Hemisphere, an observed positive trend is identified in the strength of the Southern Annular Mode since 1950, especially in austral summer. While stratospheric ozone depletion and GHG increases largely contributed to this change, climate models still have trouble simulating the SAM and its response to ozone and GHGs. Shifts in the southwesterly winds and the expansion of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell influence SAM-related rainfall anomalies in in southern South America and southern Australia during the austral springsummer. Over New Zealand, large-scale SLP and zonal wind patterns associated with SAM phases modulate regional river flow. The SAM also influences precipitation and water vapour changes over Antarctica via moisture fluxes but CMIP5 models are limted in their ability to simulate these regional teleconnections. SAM and its interaction with other large-scale modes of climate variability, like ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole, are responsible for fluctuations in Southern African rainfall and southern South America. In May, the SAM can trigger a southern Indian Ocean dipole SSTA favoring more or less precipitation over the Indian sub-continent and adjacent areas, also affecting subsequent summer monsoon in the South China Sea. Over South America, a positive SAM is associated with dry conditions due to reduced frontal and orographic precipitation and weakening of moisture convergence. Regions particularly affected include Chile and the rivers of central Patagonia. In summary, while the attribution of 20th century variations of the NAM/NAO is still unclear, there is a strong relationship with precipitation changes over Europe and in the Mediterranean region. SAM teleconnections are associated with changes in moisture transport and extend to South America, Australia and Antarctica with documented drying occurring as a result of the very likely human-induced SAM trend toward its positive phase observed from the 1970s until the 1990s. 8.4 What are the projected water cycle changes?"}

For example, and as further assessed in Section 8.4.2, CMIP6 models project a northward shift in the tropical rain belt over eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean and a southward shift in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic oceans. A projected strengthening and tightening of the tropical rain belt increases the contrasts between wet and dry tropical weather regimes and seasons. It is less clear how the well understood poleward expansion of the subtropics and mid-latitude storm tracks influences precipitation over sub-tropical and mid-latitude continents. An ensemble of 31 CMIP6 models under the SSP5-8.5 scenario projects increases of precipitation by 109 30% over much of the United States and decreases by 1040% over Central America and the Caribbean by 2080-2099. This CMIP6 ensemble also projects an increase in annual precipitation over the southern Arabian Peninsula and a decrease over the northern Arabian Peninsula, as also projected by CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. Annual mean precipitation is projected to increase over South Asia during the 21st century under all scenarios, although the rate of change varies within the region based on 27 CMIP6 models. CMIP6 projections also display a reduction in annual mean precipitation over northern and southern Africa while increases are projected over central Africa, under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The AR6 Atlas assesses that regions where annual mean rainfall is likely to increase include the Ethiopian Highlands, East, South and North Asia, southeastern South America, northern Europe, northern and eastern North America, and the Polar Regions. In contrast, regions where annual mean rainfall is likely to decrease include southern Africa, coastal West Africa, Amazonia, southwestern Australia, Central America, southwestern South America, and the Mediterranean. AR5 identified that high-latitude precipitation increase may lead to an increase in snowfall in the coldest regions and a decrease of snowfall in warmer regions due to a decreased number of freezing days. The fraction of precipitation falling as snow and the duration of snow cover was projected to decrease. Heavy snowfall events globally are not expected to decrease significantly with warming as they occur close to the water freezing point, which will migrate poleward and in altitude. There are only a small number of studies evaluating the implications of this mechanism in specific regions. A study for the northeastern US indicates smaller reductions for major snowfall events against the broader decline in snowfall expected from thermodynamic effects. Arctic snowfall is projected to decrease as rainfall makes up more of the precipitation. Beyond annual or seasonal mean precipitation amounts, an implication of the parallel intensification of the global water cycle and of the increased residence time of atmospheric water vapour is that the distribution of daily and sub-daily precipitation intensities will experience significant changes, with fewer but potentially stronger events. CMIP6 projections show that in the long-term more drier days but more intense single events of precipitation are expected, regardless of scenario. Over almost all land regions, it is very likely that extreme precipitation will intensify at a rate close to the 7% per 1oC of global warming, but with large spatial differences. The projected increase in precipitable water is expected to lead to an increase in the highest possible precipitation intensities and an increase in the probability of occurrence of extreme precipitation events on the global scale, regardless of how annual mean precipitation changes. The projected increase in heavy precipitation intensity is also found for daily mean precipitation intensity though at a lower rate. An increase in the number of dry days is also projected in several regions of the world (Polade et al., 2014,), which can dominate the annual precipitation change at least in the subtropics. These findings are supported by CMIP6 projections showing a widespread increase in daily mean precipitation intensity over land as well as an increase in the number of dry days in the subtropics and over Amazonia and Central America. Such changes in precipitation regimes, as well as the general increase in the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes, contribute to an overall increase in precipitation variability.

Additional changes in seasonality may manifest in the timing and duration of wet seasons. A later monsoon onset trend was reported throughout India from 1901 to 2013. Conversely, an earlier rainfall onset was implicated in increased springtime rainfall over the Tibetan Plateau in recent decades. Winter and early spring precipitation over the northwestern Himalaya for the period 1951-2007 shows an increasing trend of daily precipitation extremes in association with enhanced amplitude variations of extra-tropical synoptic-scale systems known as Western Disturbances. In China, an earlier onset was observed during 1961-2012. In the African Sahel, rainfall has been most concentrated in the peak of the rainy season since the end of the 20th century. A shift in the seasonality of Sahelian rainfall, including delayed cessation has also been reported. Over southern Africa, an observed earlier onset is in contrast to a simulated historical and projected future delay in the wet season. An increasingly early onset of the North American monsoon has been observed from 1978 to 2009. Seasonality changes in the South American monsoon indicate delayed onsets since 1978. In northern high latitudes, a shorter snow season is mainly due to an earlier onset of spring snowmelt which has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Changes in snow seasonality affect streamflow at the regional scale, with an earlier peak in spring and a possible decrease of low-level flow in summer, while glacier shrinking can also alter the low-level flow in mountain catchments. This can be partly ameliorated by water management in regulated catchments, but not in large river basins such as the Amazon which also shows an increased seasonality of discharge since 1979. Increasing aridity contrasts between wet and dry seasons over the late 20th century have been suggested, with a human-induced decrease of water availability during the dry season over Europe, western North America, northern Asia, southern South America, Australia and eastern Africa. Seasonal contrasts in microwave surface soil moisture measurements have also increased over 1979-2016. Terrestrial water storage variations derived from gravimetric measurements since 2003 show a strong seasonality which is underestimated by global hydrological models and whose multidecadal trends are difficult to interpret given the direct effect of enhanced water use. In summary, there is medium confidence that the annual range of precipitation has increased since the 1980s, at least in subtropical regions and over the Amazon. There is low confidence that this increase is due to human influence and that GHG forcing has already altered the timing or duration of wet seasons. There is high confidence that the human-induced retreat of the springtime snow cover and melting of glaciers have already contributed to changes in streamflow seasonality in high-latitude and low-elevation mountain catchments, and medium confidence that human activities have also contributed to an increased seasonality of water availability, including a drier dry season, in the extratropics. Projected changes AR5 reported with high confidence that the contrast between wet and dry seasons will generally increase with global warming and that monsoon onset dates will likely become earlier or show little change, while monsoon retreat dates will likely be delayed, resulting in a lengthening of the wet season in many regions. Since AR5, several studies have further documented a projected increase in rainfall seasonality and the understanding of the underlying mechanisms has been improved. CMIP5 models show that the seasonal concentration of annual precipitation will increase over many regions by the end of the 21st century, with robust model agreement in most subtropical regions where an increase in the mean"}

The semi-arid, winter rainfall dominated subtropical climate is projected to shift poleward and eastward, with the equatorward margins replaced by a more arid climate type. However, evolving SST patterns and land-ocean warming contrasts cause more complex responses. Projections over California show a stronger and shorter wet season. Decreases in future winter and spring rainfall are projected over southwestern Australia. Central Asia is projected to experience wetter winters, associated with an increase in snow depth in the northeastern regions. Even in a +2C climate, both extreme precipitation and dryness will increase significantly in the extratropics, amplifying the seasonal precipitation range. A single-model study shows that the annual range of precipitation increases globally by 2.6% per C of global warming in stabilized low-warming scenarios. In the tropics, an amplified annual cycle of global land monsoon hydroclimates is projected by CMIP5 models under the RCP8.5 scenario, mostly due to a more intense wet season. A longer rainy season is projected by CMIP6 models over most regional monsoon areas except in the Americas. A delayed onset and cessation of the wet season over West Africa and the Sahel and a slightly delayed onset of South Asian monsoon rainfall are projected by CMIP5 models. CMIP5 projections suggest a strengthening of the annual cycle and a lengthening of the dry season in Southern Amazonia. This is further verified by the projections from 6 CMIP6 models. A wet season shorter by 5-10 days by the end to the 21st century is projected for southern Africa. An increase in streamflow seasonality is projected over several large rivers in the low-mitigation RCP8.5 scenario, but with only small changes in the seasonality timing, except in northern high latitudes due to the earlier but potentially slower snowmelt in a warmer world. At the end of the century in a high-emission scenario, peak snowmelt timing is projected to occur one month earlier and peak water volume is 79% lower in the eastern USA. Earlier snow melt is projected e.g. by 30 days at the end of the 21st century in RCP4.5 for the Sierra Nevada in the western USA. Sub-seasonal changes in water availability were found in many regions in the RCP8.5 scenario. However these should be considered with caution given the magnitude of model errors. Increases in the seasonality of water availability has been found to be more pronounced in areas with high atmospheric evaporative demand, giving rise to a pattern of seasonally variable regimes becoming even more variable. RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 projections show a pronounced soil drying in summer and autumn over western Europe, and a springtime drying over northern Europe due to an earlier snowmelt. A simple relative seasonality metric applied to global projections based on CMIP6 models and SSP scenarios supports previous CMIP5 findings, especially the amplified seasonality of precipitation around the Mediterranean, and across southern Africa, California, southern Australia and the Amazon. While such changes are not significant in the low-emission SSP1-2.6 scenario, they are consistent with the increased frequency of dry days projected over the same regions. In monsoon regions outside the Americas, rainfall seasonality does not show a significant increase even in high-emission scenarios. This challenges previous CMIP5 findings based on the difference between maximum and minimum monthly precipitation in a year and higher sensitivity to the projected increase in precipitation extremes. In the northern high-latitudes, milder winters are associated with wetter conditions and a decrease in precipitation seasonality. In summary, the annual range of precipitation, water availability and streamflow will increase with global warming over subtropical regions and the Amazon, especially around the Mediterranean and across southern Africa. The contrast between the wettest and driest month of the year is likely to increase by 3 to 5%/C with global warming in most monsoon regions, in terms of precipitation, water availability and runoff. There is medium confidence that the monsoon season could be delayed in a warmer climate in the Sahel. There is high confidence of earlier snowmelt."}

Even under a low-emissions scenario, projections of soil moisture show significant decreases in the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and the Amazon basin. Under midand high-emissions scenarios, coherent declines emerge across Europe, westernmost North Africa, southwestern Australia, Central America, southwestern North America, and southwestern South America. Compared to CMIP5 results, CMIP6 models exhibit more consistent drying in the Amazon basin, more extensive declines in total soil moisture in Siberia, and stronger declines in westernmost North Africa and southwestern Australia. Soil moisture in the top soil layer shows more widespread drying than total soil moisture, reflecting a greater sensitivity of the upper soil layer to increasing evaporative demand. Conversely, total column soil moisture represents the carry-over of moisture from previous seasons deeper in the soil column, and potentially higher sensitivity to vegetation processes. Central America, the Amazon basin, the Mediterranean region, southern Africa, and southwestern Australia are projected to experience significant declines in total soil moisture, whereas declines in Europe, western Siberia, and northeastern North America are limited to the surface. It should be noted that because models differ in their number of hydrologically active layers, there is less confidence in total soil moisture projections than surface soil moisture projections. Based on surface soil moisture projections, more than 40% of global land areas are expected to experience robust year-round drying, even under lower emissions scenarios. The percentage of land area experiencing drying is slightly lower when runoff is used as an aridity metric instead; taking this into consideration, it is estimated that about a third of global land areas will experience at least moderate drying in response to anthropogenic emissions, even under SSP1-2.6. Although there are regions where multiple models predict consistent and significant changes in soil moisture, as with evapotranspiration, there is still uncertainty in these projections related to the response of plants to elevated CO2. Most models project increases in two variables that have opposite effects on surface water availability: plant water use efficiency and leaf area index. As discussed in Section 8.2.3.3, 8.3.1.4, and 8.4.1.4, there is low confidence in how these changes in plant physiology will affect future projections of evapotranspiration, and likewise, drought and aridity.

SROCC noted that these declines are projected to continue almost everywhere over the 21st century, with complete glacier loss expected in regions with only small glaciers. SROCC supported the AR5 finding that glacier recession would continue even without further changes in climate. SROCC concluded that cryosphere changes had already altered the seasonal timing and volume of runoff, which in turn had affected water resources and agriculture, and projected peak water runoff had already been reached before 2019 in some of the glacier regions considered. Chapter 9 provides detailed assessment of glacier observations and projections. Here, a summary of their key findings is presented. Since SROCC, the coordinated glacier model intercomparison project (GlacierMIP, see also Box 9.3) has advanced modelling efforts. Global glacier volumes will substantially decline in coming decades regardless of emissions scenario; under a high emission scenario some areas will lose nearly all of their glacier mass. The projected global glacier mass loss over 2015-2100 is 29 000  20 000 Gt for SSP1-2.6 to 58 000  30 000 Gt for SSP5-8.5. Because of their lagged response to warming, glaciers will continue to lose mass for decades even if global temperature is stabilized. Global glacier mass loss projections show a scenario-dependent geographic partitioning of when peak in runoff occurs, consistent with previous studies. Under a low emission scenario all regions exhibit runoff in the decades prior to 2050. Under a high emission scenario however, low and mid-latitude regions show peak runoff before approximately 2060, whereas Arctic regions peak in later decades around 2070-2090. Antarctic glacier losses will not have peaked by the end of the century in the high emission scenario. Globally, peak runoff of 2.5 to 3 mm / year sea level equivalent occurs around 2090. Regional projections are presented in detail in Section 9.5.1 and Figure 9.21, and briefly summarized below. Himalaya and Central Asia: Glaciers in the Himalayas feed ten of the worlds most important river systems and are critical water sources for nearly two billion people However they are some of the most vulnerable water towers that are projected to experience volume losses of approximately 30 to 100% by 2100 depending on global emissions scenarios. Under mid-range emissions scenarios glaciers in this region are projected to reach peak runoff during the period 2020 to 2040. Alaska, Yukon, British Columbia: Post-AR5 but pre-SROCC projections indicated a potential 70  10% reduced volume of glacier ice in western Canada relative to 2005, with few glaciers remaining in the Interior and Rockies regions and maritime glaciers in northwestern British Columbia surviving only in a diminished state. Recent global projections support these earlier findings, showing that glacier mass in Western Canada and the United States may reduce by 50% under low emissions scenarios and be completely lost under the highest emissions and most sensitive glacier model combinations. Arctic Canada and Alaskan glaciers are projected to experience more modest mass loss. Andes: Huss and Hock concluded that peak glacier mass was reached prior to 2019 for 8295% of the glacier area in the tropical Andes. This is consistent with more recent global model simulations that show mass loss rates from low latitude glaciers that universally decline from the start of simulations in 2015, regardless of emissions scenario.

The main driver of future expansion appears to be greenhouse gas forcing, with uncertainty in magnitude due to internal variability. Proposed mechanisms for poleward expansion include increased dry static stability, increased tropopause height, stratospheric influences and radiative effects of clouds and water vapour. Hadley cell expansion is thought to be associated with the precipitation declines projected in many subtropical regions, but more recent work suggests that these reductions are mainly due to the direct radiative effect of CO2 forcing, land-sea contrasts in the response to forcing and SST changes. In semi-arid, winter rainfall-dominated regions, thermodynamic processes associated with the land-sea thermal contrast and lapse rate changes dominate the projected precipitation decline in summer, whereas circulation changes are of greater importance in winter. The hydroclimates in these regions are projected to evolve with time due to changing contributions from rapid atmospheric circulation changes and their associated SST responses, as well as slower SST responses to anthropogenic forcing. In summary, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models project a weakening of the Hadley cells, with high confidence for the Northern Hemisphere in boreal winter and low confidence for the Southern Hemisphere in austral winter. The Hadley cells are projected to expand polewards with global warming, most notably in the Southern Hemisphere. There is currently low confidence in the impacts on regional precipitation in subtropical regions. 8.4.2.3 Walker circulation AR5 determined that the Pacific Walker circulation was likely to slow down over the 21st century, which would lead to decreased precipitation over the western tropical Pacific and increases over the central and eastern Pacific. Recent studies show consistency with AR5 conclusions but also show an eastward shift over the Pacific, mostly due to a shift towards more El Ninolike conditions under global warming. Other studies suggest that the weakening of the Walker circulation is related to the response of the western North Pacific monsoon and to changing landsea temperature contrasts, while a positive ocean32 atmosphere feedback amplifies the weakening of both eastwest SST gradient and trade winds in the tropical Pacific. Since AR5, the paradox between the projected weakening and the observed strengthening of the Walker circulation since the 1990s has triggered debate about the drivers of these changes. Projected changes in equatorial SST gradients are not entirely consistent with observed trends, and one CMIP5 model that projects a future strengthening of the Walker circulation is more consistent with observations than other models. Other studies suggest that these differences arises from the dominant influence of internal climate variability to the observed trends, or as a consequence of a systematic cold bias of most CMIP5 models in their Equatorial Pacific cold tongues. However, the latter hypothesis is based on a simplified model of tropical Pacific dynamics and is not consistent with the current physical understanding of the tropical circulation response to increasing CO2 levels or with independent paleoclimate evidence suggesting a weaker Walker circulation under warmer climates. Different time scales of the tropical Pacific responses to global warming have been highlighted by numerical experiments with both comprehensive and simplified models. Results suggest a transient strengthening of the Walker circulation related to Indian Ocean warming, followed by a slower weakening linked to a strengthened eastern Pacific cold tongue warming emerging after 50-100 years. CMIP6 projections provide further evidence of a significant long-term weakening of the Walker circulation.

In summary, there is high confidence that the Pacific Walker circulation will weaken by the end of the 21st century, and will be associated with decreased precipitation over the western tropical Pacific and increases farther east. Discrepancies between observed and simulated changes in SSTs in the tropics indicate that a temporary strengthening of the Walker Circulation can arise from a transient response to GHG radiative forcing and from internal variability.

The central figures show precipitation minus evaporation changes at 3C or global warming relative to a 1850-1900 base period. Annual mean changes include contours depicting control climate P-E=0 lines with the solid contour enclosing the tropical rain belt region and dashed lines representing the edges of subtropical regions. Confidence levels assess understanding of how large-scale circulation change affect the regional water. 8.4.2.4 Monsoons In AR5, monsoon precipitation over land was projected to intensify by the end of the 21st century, due to thermodynamic increases in moisture convergence despite weakening of the tropical circulation. Following the definition of regional monsoons in Annex V and Figure 8.11, and the assessment of the observed changes, here we provide an assessment of projected changes in regional monsoons. Assessment is provided either in terms of SSP and RCP scenarios and global warming levels available since AR5, or from the newly available CMIP6 projections.

Over South Asia, the moisture-bearing monsoon low-level jet is projected to shift northward in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. Greater warming over the Asian land region compared to the ocean contributes to intensification of the monsoon low-level southwesterly winds and precipitation, even though the combined effect of upper and lower tropospheric warming makes the Asian monsoon circulation response rather complicated.

Table 8.2 confirms that changes in runoff and P-E over SAsiaM region are positive and largest in the higher emission scenarios considered, as in precipitation. On the other hand, changes in the ensemble mean for all the variables considered in the SSP1-1.9 scenario are negative for both mid and long term periods. This is also consistently reflected in the spatial map of future precipitation changes. Different near-term projections of the SAsiaM may result given the diversity in the future aerosol emission pathways and policies for regulating air pollution. Additionally, near-term projections of SAsiaM precipitation are expected to be constrained by internal variability associated with the PDV. CMIP6 models also indicate a lengthening of the summer monsoon over India by the end of the 21st century, at least in SSP2-4.5, with considerable inter-model spread in the projected late retreat. In summary, consistent with AR5, there is high confidence that SAsiaM precipitation is projected to increase during the 21st century in response to continued global warming across the CMIP6 higher emissions scenarios, mostly in the mid and long terms. 8.4.2.4.2 East Asian Monsoon"}

Since AR5, there has been improved understanding of future projected changes in the EAsiaM. CMIP5 projections indicated a possible intensification of the EAsiaM circulation during the 21st century, in addition to precipitation increase, although there is a lack of consensus on changes in the western North Pacific subtropical high, this is an important feature of the EAsiaM circulation. Furthermore, the EAsiaM precipitation enhancements in the CMIP5 projections are prominent over the southern part of the Baiu rainband by the late 21st century, with no significant changes in the Meiyu precipitation over central-eastern China. It was also shown that the Baiu precipitation response in CMIP5 projections is accompanied by a southward retreat of the western North Pacific subtropical high and a southward shift of the East Asian subtropical jet. According to the high-resolution MRI-AGCM global warming experiments, future summer precipitation could potentially increase on the southern side and decrease on the northern side of the present-day Baiu location in response to downwardmotion tendencies which can offset the wet-gets-wetter effect, but is subject to large model uncertainties. Future projections of land warming over the Eurasian continent and intensified land-sea thermal contrast can potentially intensify the EAsiaM circulation during the 21st century. However, there are large uncertainties in projected water cycle changes over the region, mostly in the near-term because of uncertainties in future aerosol emission scenarios, as well as due to the interplay between internal variability and anthropogenic external forcing. Interhemispheric mass exchange can act as a bridge connecting Southern Hemisphere circulation with EAsiaM rainfall, however this interhemispheric link is projected to weaken in a future warmer climate as seen from a CCSM4 projection using the RCP8.5 scenario. A comparison of 1.5C and 2C global warming levels reveals how a 0.5C difference could result in precipitation enhancement over large areas of East Asia, with substantial increases in the frequency and intensity of extremes. Future monsoon projections from the CMIP6 models show increase of EAsiaM precipitation across all the scenarios, though with a large model spread mostly on the long-term and in the higher emission scenarios. Considering all the five scenarios used across the report, changes in precipitation, runoff and P-E over the EAsiaM are positive and become larger for highest emission scenarios and for the long term mean, except for the mid-term SSP1-1.9 scenario where the changes are close to zero or even negative. Additionally, CMIP6 models confirm a projected increased length of the EAsiaM season due to early onset and late retreat. In summary, despite the uncertainties in the monsoon circulation response in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, there is high confidence that summer monsoon precipitation over East Asia will increase in the 21st century and medium confidence that the monsoon season will be longer. 8.4.2.4.3 West African Monsoon"}

However, the magnitude of WAfriM projected precipitation depends on the convective parameterization used, and large uncertainties remain in WAfriM projections because of large inter-model spread, particularly over the western Sahel. CMIP6 models show a general increase of WAfriM precipitation across all future scenarios but with a substantial model spread for the SSP5-8.5 scenario. This sensitivity arises from the combined and contrasting influences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing that affect WAfriM precipitation directly and also indirectly through sub-tropical North Atlantic SST changes.

Rainfall distribution is projected to be highly variable with a decrease in the number of rainy days in the western Sahel, consistent with an increase in consecutive dry days and a reduction in the number of growing season days. A decrease in the frequency but an increase in the intensity of very wet events is projected to be more pronounced over the Sahel than over Guinean coast, and also under higher emission scenarios. In summary, post-AR5 studies and newly available CMIP6 results indicate projected rainfall increases in the eastern-central WAfriM region but decreases in the west, with a delayed wet season.

AR5 reported medium confidence that precipitation associated with the NAmerM will arrive later in the annual cycle and persist longer. Since AR5, analyses of CMIP5 projections suggest little change in the overall amount of NAmerM precipitation in response to rising global surface temperature. However, significant declines are projected in the early monsoon season and increases in the late monsoon season, suggesting a shift in seasonality toward a delayed monsoon onset and demise. It is recognised that CMIP5 models are generally too coarsely-resolved to simulate the Gulf of California and the moisture surges associated with the NAmerM. Under different RCPs, CMIP5 models tend to project a reduction in NAmerM precipitation but an increase in extreme precipitation events. The almost unchanged or slight decrease in NAmerM total precipitation amount under global warming projections is at odds with paleoclimate records that suggest increased monsoon precipitation under past warm conditions. However, there is low agreement on how those changes and the mechanisms that drive them are affected under different RCPs since most simulations are model-dependant. Projections from six CMIP6 models show a shortening of the NAmerM under the SSP5-8.5 scenario due to earlier demises. In addition, CMIP6 projections show a decrease in NAmerM precipitation under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios by the end of the 21st century with large inter-model spread. This result is also supported by the analysis of 31 CMIP6 models under the SSTP5-8.5 scenario for the 2080-2099 period. Non-linearities and uncertainties in the NAmerM projected changes are valid for many water cycle variables, like precipitation, runoff and P-E. In summary, there is low agreement on a projected decrease of NAmerM precipitation, however there is high confidence in delayed onsets and demises of the summer monsoon. 8.4.2.4.5 South American Monsoon"}

In contrast, other studies indicate projected earlier onsets and delayed retreats of the SAmerM under the RCP8.5 scenario based on six CMIP5 models. These differences have been linked to the methodology used to determine monsoon timing, and sensitivity to the monsoon domain considered. Recent studies provide further evidence for the projection of delayed SAmerM onsets by the late 21 century. An analysis of six CMIP6 models under the SSP5-8.5 scenario confirm the projections of delayed SAmerM onsets by the end of the 21st century. In addition, projected changes in the intensity and length of the SAmerM season have been found to be model-dependent. The analysis of CMIP5 projections of total monsoon rainfall indicate mixed signals in the Amazon and SAmerM regions, with some studies suggesting increased summer precipitation in the core SAmerM region. Dynamical downscaling of CMIP5 projections under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios with the Eta RCM suggests reductions of austral summer precipitation over the SAmerM region throughout the 21st century. Further analysis using 15 different CMIP6 models for the SSP2-4.5 scenario suggest reductions in total SAmerM rainfall. However, other analyses of CMIP6 projections under different SSP scenarios do not report clear changes in the SAmerM precipitation throughout the 21st century, Figure 8.22). Similar uncertainties for all the SSP scenarios used across the report are found for other water cycle variables, including runoff and P-E. Furthermore, there is disagreement in projected extreme precipitation in the region, with some CMIP5-based studies suggest reductions, while others indicate increases based on CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. In summary, there is high confidence that the SAmerM will experience delayed onsets in association with increases in GHG.

CMIP6 models project increased AusMCM precipitation in the 21st century but with a more robust signal in SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 rather than in lower emission scenarios. A reduced range of CMIP6 rainfall projections but continued disagreement on the sign of change is reported over Australia. The northern and eastern parts of the Maritime Continent have projected increases in rainfall in CMIP5 models, while there are projected decreases over Java, Sulawesi and southern parts of Borneo and Sumatra. Rainfall changes are correlated with the extent of warming in the western tropical Pacific in CMIP5 models but inter-model differences are also related to modelled large-scale zonal mean precipitation response in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 model ensembles. Decomposition of projected rainfall changes indicates that the largest source of model uncertainty is associated with shifts in the spatial pattern of convection. Uncertainties in capturing the spatial and temporal features of the Maritime Continent monsoon depend also on the horizontal resolution of coupled climate models. The role of anthropogenic aerosol forcing in future projections of the Australian monsoon has been investigated for CMIP5 models; decreases in anthropogenic aerosol concentrations over the 21st century are expected to produce relatively greater warming in the Northern Hemisphere than Southern Hemisphere, favouring a northward shift of the tropical rain belt.

Zhang et al. examined changes in Australian monsoon onset and duration in CMIP3 models and found model agreement on a delay in onset and shortened duration to the north of Australia, but less agreement over the interior of the continent. An updated study of CMIP5 models found similar mean changes with delayed onset and shortened duration, but substantial model disagreement.

There is strong model agreement on an increase in monsoon precipitation over the Maritime Continent while there is low agreement on the direction of change over northern Australia. There is a projected increase in rainfall variability over northern Australia, with increased intensity of rainfall during the active or burst phase. 8.4.2.5 Tropical cyclones Tropical cyclones projections are primarily assessed in section 11.7.1.5. Here, we extend this analysis by assessing the implications of projected changes in tropical cyclones on the water cycle. AR5 concluded that TC rainfall rate was likely to increase through the 21st century. Section 11.7.1.5 assesses that the average tropical cyclone rain-rate is projected to increase with warming, and peak rain-rates are projected to increase at greater than the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling rate of 7% per 1C of warming in some regions due to increased low-level moisture convergence. The increase in TC rainfall rate is explained by increased TC intensity resulting from increasing SSTs, and increased environmental water vapour.

Several studies based on CMIP5 projections show changes in Northern Hemisphere winter stationary waves that increase precipitation over the west coast of North America and decrease it over the eastern Mediterranean and parts of southwestern North America (Neelin et al., 2013; Seager et al., 2014a, 2014b,"}

For the Northern Hemisphere winter global teleconnection pattern, the majority of the models analyzed in project the development of a preferred longitudinal phasing for the pattern, but with strong disagreement among models over the details of the phasing and therefore the associated regional hydrologic impacts. While the potential role of increasing hydrologic extremes with quasi-resonant stationary waves during Northern Hemisphere summer has received considerable attention, as yet there is no clear evidence in model projections that this variability will increase. The influence of the Arctic on midlatitude circulation is assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 10.1, which reports that there is low confidence in the dominant contribution of Arctic warming compared to other drivers in future projections. Potential changes to the stratospheric polar vortex in CMIP5 models have a substantial influence on tropospheric stationary waves and associated hydrologic impacts in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. CMIP5 models have some important limitations in their representation of stationary waves and this aspect of CMIP6 models has not yet been comprehensively evaluated. In summary, future changes in stationary waves may have an important influence on both the mean state and variability of the water cycle. Limitations in model representation, dynamical understanding, and the number of targeted studies on the topic currently constrain the assessment of future changes in stationary waves. Based on current knowledge, there is low confidence that projected changes in stationary wave activity will contribute to decreases of cold season precipitation over the eastern Mediterranean and increases over the west coast of North America. 8.4.2.7 Atmospheric blocking In AR5, the increased ability of models to simulate blocking and higher agreement on projections led to an assessment with medium confidence that the frequency of Northern and Southern Hemisphere blocking will not increase, but future changes in blocking intensity and persistence were deemed uncertain. Blocking influences precipitation, flooding, drought, snow, and glacier melt, and so is of broad importance to the water cycle in areas of blocking activity. Blocking projections are assessed in this Report in Chapter 4, and model performance in simulating blocking is also discussed in Chapter 3. CMIP5 projections suggest a complex response in blocking frequencies with an eastward shift in Northern Hemisphere winter blocking, midlatitude decreases in boreal summer except in eastern Europe-western Russia, and Southern Hemisphere decreases in the Pacific sector during austral spring and summer. CMIP6 projections show a notable decrease in blocking activity over Greenland and the North Pacific for the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. However, the continued large differences among current models as well as the sensitivity to blocking detection methods limits confidence in projected regional changes in blocking. The influence of blocking on multiple elements of the water cycle means that the uncertainty in blocking projections adds a corresponding layer of uncertainty to water cycle projections. In summary, and despite recent improvements in the simulation of blocking, there is limited evidence in model projections of future changes, except for boreal winter over Greenland and the North Pacific where there is high confidence that blocking events are not expected to increase in the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. As with stationary waves, this adds uncertainty to mid-latitude water cycle projections at the regional scale. 8.4.2.8 Extratropical cyclones, storm tracks and atmospheric rivers"}

However, rainfall variability related to ENSO is projected to increase significantly by the second half of the 21st century, regardless of ENSO amplitude. Regional precipitation variability associated with ENSO increases due to increases in atmospheric moisture, regardless of changes in ENSO variability itself. In many regions, the magnitude of the projected changes related to ENSO is small compared with historical interannual variability. Uncertainties in precipitation projections related to ENSO depend on internal variability associated with the mode, hence the need to have relatively large ensembles to adequately estimate uncertainty. Even over regions with statistically significant simulated rainfall teleconnections during the historical period, CMIP5 models do not project clear changes. Nonetheless, CMIP5 models that realistically reproduce Indian summer monsoon rainfall indicate a strengthening of its relationship with ENSO in RCP8.5 projections, though the response is not consistent for different varieties of ENSO events. Inconsistent changes in the ENSOIndian summer monsoon relationship in response to global warming in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models may be related to statistical issues rather than dynamical changes. Over East Africa during the boreal spring and summer, ENSO teleconnections are projected to become stronger in the future. Meteorological drought consequences of each strong El Nino are projected to become more severe in the region. Indian Ocean Dipole and Indian Ocean Basin interactions with ENSO are expected to persist in the future but projected changes in the frequency and intensity of events remain uncertain. Climate extremes such as those associated with the extreme positive IOD event of 2019 are expected to occur more frequently under continued global warming. Projected changes in IOD teleconnections are linked to model performance in representing the IOD and its remote influence in the present climate, apparently dominated by a positive IOD event-like mean state.

Sensitivity studies generally project increases in Madden Julian Oscillation precipitation amplitude in a warmer climate, with increases of up to 14% per C of warming. However, in CMIP5 models with realistic historical MJO behaviour, the precipitation amplitude over the Indo-Pacific warm pool region changes from -4% to +8% per C in the RCP8.5 scenario relative to the end of the 20th Century. When simulated MJO precipitation amplitude increases with warming, the leading factor for such change is the intensification of the lower tropospheric vertical moisture gradient, that supports stronger vertical moisture advection per unit diabatic heating. In idealised simulations with constant carbon dioxide forcing with El Nino-like patterns, the MJO activity penetrates farther east into the central and east Pacific with increased warming. Increased MJO convective variability in a warmer climate does not reflect into increased ability of the MJO to force the extratropics. In summary, even though there is low confidence in how the tropical MoVs will change in the future, their regional hydrological consequences, in terms of precipitation, are projected to intensify. For example, the ENSO influence on precipitation over the IndoPacific sector is projected to strengthen and shift eastward. The MJO is projected to intensify in a warmer climate, with increased associated precipitation. 8.4.2.9.2 Extra-tropical modes"}

In the near-term, the Southern Annular Mode is projected to become less positive than observed during the end of the 20th century during the austral summer in all SSPs scenarios. In the CMIP5 RCP8.5 scenario, increased amplitude and frequency of the North Atlantic Oscillation during boreal winter is associated with higher precipitation in northern Europe and lower precipitation in southern Europe. However, large-ensembles analyses show how the NAO leads to significant uncertainty in future changes of regional climate. For example, more than a 85% increase in precipitation is projected over northern Europe, western Russia and much of eastern North America, with similar decreasing resulting in drying over northwestern Africa and regions adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea. In the Southern Hemisphere, the positive trend projected for the SAM in the CMIP5 RCP8.5 scenario appears to mitigate the wetting in the mid-to-high latitudes and the drying over the subtropics, but with strong seasonal dependence. Regional precipitation changes in South America, South Africa, Southern Australia and New Zealand are not well explained by changes in the SAM, but are related to broad-scale changes in north-south temperature gradients associated with enhanced warming of the tropical upper troposphere and strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex. In summary, projected changes in the intensity, frequency and phase of extratropical MoVs may amplify regional changes in precipitation and contribute to an increase in their intraseasonal and interannual variability. Regionally, there are potentially significant precipitation and atmospheric circulation changes associated with changes in extratropical dynamics. 8.5 What are the limits for projecting water cycle changes?"}

It is best estimated at the end of a high-emission scenario when internal variability has a limited contribution to total uncertainty.

This can also be true for other water cycle variables such as soil moisture, runoff and streamflow at the regional scale, either derived directly from global climate models or produced by offline using global hydrological models driven by the same GCMs. Although some of the model response uncertainty is related to climatological biases, model biases are not the only way to assess the reliability of climate projections.

However, such aerosol effects are muted in GCMs, which tend to produce precipitation from shallow clouds too frequently at the expense of rain intensity. This arises from incomplete knowledge of how clouds adjust to aerosol primary effects such as cloud condensation nuclei. The adjustment occurs mainly as a dynamic response to the impacts of CCN on cloud drop size and number concentrations on precipitation-forming processes.

CMIP5PMIP3 last millennium simulations reproduce the observed negative correlation between eastern Australian rainfall and the central equatorial Pacific SSTs with varying skill, and also display periods when the ENSO teleconnection weakens substantially for several decades. Differences in simulated internal variability have been found to be responsible for the inter-model spread in predicted shifts in subtropical dry zones for a given shift in the Hadley cell. CMIP5 models show that both internal variability and anthropogenic forcings are responsible for the drying over the South Atlantic Convergence Zone region, though with large uncertainties. Moreover, the detection of the anthropogenic forcing on the South Atlantic Convergence Zone is strongly dependent on the characterization of model internal variability. Beyond the tropics, North Pacific decadal variability exerts a strong modulation of extratropical ENSO teleconnections, but also influences low-frequency variability of the Walker circulation, which is underestimated by most CMIP5 models. Atlantic Multidecadal Variability teleconnections show a high model spread among CMIP5 models, both in terms of persistence and spatial coherence, which has potential consequences for the water cycle variability simulated over Europe. For example, internal variability will continue to play an important role in the variability of river flows over France in coming decades. Ensembles of atmosphere-only simulations driven by observed or reconstructed SST are useful for evaluating the ability of models to capture the circulation and/or precipitation variability observed over the historical period. However, limitations of such AGCM-based attribution methods, i.e. related to the lack of airsea interactions in the response, may lead to erroneous attribution conclusions in some regions for local circulation and mean and extreme precipitation. Other methods to measure the portion of precipitation variability include the partitioning into dynamical versus thermodynamical components, the analysis of variance and direct characterization of stochastic weather-noise. Single model initial conditions large ensembles are a powerful tool for estimating the magnitude of internal variability in historical and future climates. Using SMILEs, it has been shown, for example, that internal NAO variability imparts substantial uncertainty to future changes in European precipitation. For the South Asian summer monsoon, internal variability can overshadow the forced monsoon rainfall trend, thereby increasing near-term projection uncertainties. Specific regional applications of the use of large ensembles are further assessed in Sections 10.3.4.3 and 10.3.4.4. Since AR5, SMILEs have helped quantify the time of emergence of climate change signals. Results from SMILEs indicate that by 20002009, simulated anthropogenic shifts in mean annual precipitation already emerged over 36-41% of the globe including high latitudes, the eastern subtropical oceans, and the tropics. By 2050, more than 60% of the globe is projected to show detectable anthropogenic shifts in mean annual precipitation. Other SMILE results for the 1950-2100 period indicate that internal variability can obscure the detection of the anthropogenic hydroclimatic signal until the middle to late 21st century in many parts of the world for both mean and extreme precipitation. A common finding is that changes in the characteristics of wet extreme events will emerge earlier than changes in average conditions. An assessment of the methods used to estimate time of emergence is presented in Chapter 10. For specific regional examples of climate change attribution and emergence of anthropogenic signal, see Section 10.4.2."}

The simplest traditional pattern scaling approach approximates future changes by the product of a time-evolving global surface temperature change and a pattern that varies spatially but is constant across time, scenarios, and models. This technique was shown to be more robust across scenarios rather than across models, with better results for temperature compared with precipitation. One approach which avoids scaling is to consider a period in a different scenario with the same global surface temperature change. It is attractive as it provides patterns of any temporal resolution that are consistent across variables. Nonetheless, this technique is still only based on global surface temperature and is not necessarily suitable for precipitation changes projected in stabilized versus transient scenarios given the fast-atmospheric adjustment to GHG radiative forcing. Even in a theoretical climate system governed by linear processes, pattern-scaling assumptions can fail because the different forcing time response of different parts of the Earth system cause evolving spatial warming patterns. This occurs primarily because different feedbacks occur at different timescales, which in turn implies that the atmospheric circulation and water cycle is dependent both on the level of warming and the rate of change. The usual distinction between the fast adjustment to increased GHG concentrations and the slower response to SST warming may however not be sufficient to explain the time evolution of the hydroclimatic response at the regional scale, especially in subtropical land areas where this response critically depends on shifts in atmospheric circulation associated with distinct fast and slow SST warming patterns. The changing balance between the water cycle response to anthropogenic GHG and aerosol forcings is another source of non-linearity across time and global warming levels. Nonlinearities in the climate response are thought to arise from multiple factors. These include statedependent ice-albedo feedback and its potential influence on Northern Hemisphere storm tracks; a state-dependent sensitivity of tropical precipitation to increased SST; a complex response of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and its modeland magnitude-dependent teleconnections with regional temperature and precipitation; and other atmospheric and terrestrial processes such as cloud and land surface feedbacks. The response of convective precipitation may exhibit nonlinearities because it is itself modulated by both dynamics and atmospheric water content, each responding independently to warming. Based on a simple model, it was also suggested that the Indian summer monsoon may exhibit a moistureadvection feedback which allows multiple stable states as boundary conditions change. However, limitations of this theory and comprehensive GCMs suggest a near-linear monsoon response to a broad range of radiative forcings. Non-linear precipitation responses to global warming have been reported in the Indo-Pacific, where a linear increase in SSTs can trigger nonlinear changes in precipitation and a shift in the ITCZ depending on the relative amplitudes of uniform and structured SST anomalies."}

They are also influenced by factors like temperature, vegetation and human land and water management. In a warmer world, evaporation increases, which can make even wet regions more susceptible to drought. A drought is broadly defined as drier than normal conditions; that is, a moisture deficit relative to the average water availability at a given location and season. Since they are locally defined, a drought in a wet place will not have the same amount of water deficit as a drought in a dry region. Droughts are divided into different categories based on where in the water cycle the moisture deficit occurs: meteorological drought, hydrological drought, and agricultural or ecological drought. Special categories of drought also exist. For example, a snow drought occurs when winter snowpack levels are below average, which can cause abnormally low streamflow in subsequent seasons. And while many drought events develop slowly over months or years, some events, called flash droughts, can intensify over the course of days or weeks. One such event occurred in 2012 in the midwestern region of North America and had a severe impact on agricultural production, with losses exceeding $30 billion US dollars. Droughts typically only become a concern when they adversely affect people and/or ecosystems. When a drought lasts for a very long time it is sometimes called a megadrought. Most droughts begin when precipitation is below normal for an extended period of time. This typically occurs when high pressure in the atmosphere sets up over a region, reducing cloud formation and precipitation over that area and deflecting away storms. The lack of rainfall then propagates across the water cycle to create agricultural drought in soils and hydrological drought in waterways. Other processes act to amplify or alleviate droughts. For example, if temperatures are abnormally high, evaporation increases, drying out soils and streams and stressing plants beyond what would have occurred from the lack of precipitation alone. Vegetation can play a critical role because it modulates many important hydrologic processes. Human activities can also determine how severe a drought is. For example, irrigating croplands can reduce the socioeconomic impact of a drought; at the same time, depletion of groundwater in aquifers can make a drought worse. The effect of climate change on drought varies across regions. In the subtropical regions like the Mediterranean, southern Africa, southwestern Australia and southwestern South America, as well as tropical central America, western Africa and the Amazon basin, precipitation is expected to decline as the world warms, increasing the possibility that drought will occur throughout the year. Warming will decrease snowpack, amplifying drought in regions where snowmelt is an important water resource. Higher temperatures lead to increased evaporation, resulting in soil drying, increased plant stress, and impacts on agriculture, even in regions where large changes in precipitation are not expected. If emissions of greenhouse gases are not curtailed, about a third of global land areas are projected to suffer from at least moderate drought by 2100. On the other hand, some areas and seasons may experience increases in precipitation as a result of climate change, which will decrease the likelihood of droughts.

Precipitation changes are computed from observations and from DAMIP CMIP6 experiments over the historical period with allforcing, GHG-only forcing, Aerosol-only and Natural forcings prescribed. Observations are based on the CRU and GPCC datasets and the APHRODITE dataset for SAsiaM and EAsiaM. CMIP6 simulations are taken from nine CMIP6 models contributing to DAMIP, with at least 3 members. Ensembles are weight-averaged for the respective model ensemble size. Observed trends are shown as colored cirles and the simulated trends from the CMIP6 multi-model experiments are shown as box-whisker plots. Precipitation anomaly time-series are shown in the second and third row. The thick black line is the multi-model ensemble-mean precipitation anomaly time-series from the ALL experiment and the grey shading shows the spread across the multimodel ensembles.

The regionally opposing trends result primarily from changing regional wind forcing. There is low confidence in model simulations of past and future Antarctic sea ice evolution due to deficiencies of process representation, in particular at the regional level. Ice Sheets The Greenland Ice Sheet has lost 4890 Gt mass over the period 19922020, equivalent to 13.5 mm global mean sea level rise. The mass-loss rate was on average 39 Gt yr1 over the period 19921999, 175 Gt yr1 over the period 20002009 and 243 Gt yr1 over the period 20102019. This mass loss is driven by both discharge and surface melt, with the latter increasingly becoming the dominating component of mass loss with high interannual variability in the last decade. The largest mass losses occurred in the Northwest and the Southeast of Greenland. The Antarctic Ice Sheet has lost 2670 Gt mass over the period 19922020, equivalent to 7.4 mm global mean sea level rise. The mass-loss rate was on average 49 Gt yr1 over the period 19921999, 70 Gt yr1 over the period 20002009 and 148 Gt yr1 over the period 20102019. Mass losses from West Antarctic outlet glaciers outpaced mass gain from increased snow accumulation on the continent and dominated the ice sheet mass losses since 1992. These mass losses from the West Antarctic outlet glaciers were mainly induced by ice shelf basal melt and locally by ice shelf disintegration preceded by strong surface melt. Parts of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet have lost mass in the last two decades. Both the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Antarctic Ice Sheet will continue to lose mass throughout this century under all considered SSP scenarios. The related contribution to global mean sea level rise until 2100 from the Greenland Ice Sheet will likely be 0.010.10 m under SSP 1-2.6, 0.040.13 m under SSP2-4.5 and 0.090.18 m under SSP5-8.5, while the Antarctic Ice Sheet will likely contribute 0.030.27 m under SSP1-2.6, 0.030.29 m under SSP2-4.5 and 0.030.34 m under SSP5-8.5. The loss of ice from Greenland will become increasingly dominated by surface melt, as marine margins retreat and the ocean-forced dynamic response of ice-sheet margins diminishes. In the Antarctic, dynamic losses driven by ocean warming and ice shelf disintegration will likely continue to outpace increasing snowfall this century. Beyond 2100, total mass loss from both ice sheets will be greater under high-emission scenarios than under low-emission scenarios. The assessed likely ranges consider those ice-sheet processes in whose representation in current models we have at least medium confidence, including surface mass balance and grounding-line retreat in the absence of instabilities. Under high-emission scenarios, poorly understood processes related to Marine Ice Sheet Instability and Marine Ice Cliff Instability, characterized by deep uncertainty, have the potential to strongly increase Antarctic mass loss on century to multi-century time scales. Glaciers Glaciers lost 6200 Gt of mass over the period 1993 to 2019 and will continue losing mass under all SSP scenarios. During the decade 2010 to 2019, glaciers lost more mass than in any other decade since the beginning of the observational record. For all regions with long-term observations, glacier mass in the decade 2010 to 2019 is the smallest since at least the beginning of the 20th century. Because of their lagged response, glaciers will continue to lose mass at least for several decades even if global temperature is stabilized. Glaciers will lose 29,000 Gt"}

Complete permafrost thaw in recent decades is a common phenomenon in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost regions. Permafrost warmed globally by 0.29 C between 2007 and 2016. An increase in the active layer thickness is a pan-Arctic phenomenon, subject to strong heterogeneity in surface conditions. The volume of perennially frozen soil within the upper 3 m of the ground will decrease by about 25% per 1C of global surface air temperature change. Snow Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover extent has been decreasing since 1978, and there is high confidence that this trend extends back to 1950. Further decrease of Northern Hemisphere seasonal snow cover extent is virtually certain under further global warming. The observed sensitivity of Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent to Northern Hemisphere land surface air temperature for 19812010 is 1.9 million km2 per 1C throughout the snow season. It is virtually certain that Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent will continue to decrease as global climate continues to warm, and process understanding strongly suggests that this also applies to Southern Hemisphere seasonal snow cover. Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover extent will decrease by about 8% per 1C of global surface air temperature change. Sea Level Global mean sea level rose faster in the 20th century than in any prior century over the last three millennia, with a 0.20 m rise over the period 1901 to 2018. GMSL rise has accelerated since the late 1960s, with an average rate of 2.3 mm yr-1 over the period 19712018 increasing to 3.7 mm yr-1 over the period 20062018. New observation-based estimates published since SROCC lead to an assessed sea level rise over the period 1901 to 2018 that is consistent with the sum of individual components. While ocean thermal expansion and mass loss from glaciers dominate the total change from 1901 to 2018, ice sheet mass loss has increased and accounts for about 35% of the sea level increase during the period 20062018. At the basin scale, sea levels rose fastest in the Western Pacific and slowest in the Eastern Pacific over the period 19932018. Regional differences in sea level arise from ocean dynamics; changes in Earth gravity, rotation and deformation due to land-ice and land-water changes; and vertical land motion. Temporal variability in ocean dynamics dominates regional patterns on annual to decadal time scales. The anthropogenic signal in regional sea level change will emerge in most regions by 2100."}

Observations show that high tide flooding events that occurred five times per year during the period 19601980 occurred on average more than eight times per year during the period 19952014. Under the assumption that other contributors to extreme sea levels remain constant, extreme sea levels that occurred once per century in the recent past will occur annually or more frequently at about 1931% of tide gauges by 2050 and at about 60% to 82% of tide gauges by 2100. In total, such extreme sea levels will occur about 20 to 30 times more frequently by 2050 and 160 to 530 times more frequently by 2100 compared to the recent past, as inferred from the median amplification factors for SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5. Over the 21st century, the majority of coastal locations will experience a median projected regional sea level rise within +/20% of the median projected GMSL change. It is virtually certain that global mean sea level will continue to rise through 2100, because all assessed contributors to global mean sea level are likely to virtually certain to continue contributing throughout this century. Considering only processes for which projections can be made with at least medium confidence, relative to the period 19952014 GMSL will rise by 2050 between 0.18 m and 0.23 m, and by 2100 between 0.38 m and 0.77 m. This GMSL rise is primarily caused by thermal expansion and mass loss from glaciers and ice sheets, with minor contributions from changes in land-water storage. These likely range projections do not include those ice-sheet-related processes that are characterized by deep uncertainty. Higher amounts of GMSL rise before 2100 could be caused by earlier-than-projected disintegration of marine ice shelves, the abrupt, widespread onset of Marine Ice Sheet Instability and Marine Ice Cliff Instability around Antarctica, and faster-than-projected changes in the surface mass balance and discharge from Greenland. These processes are characterised by deep uncertainty arising from limited process understanding, limited availability of evaluation data, uncertainties in their external forcing and high sensitivity to uncertain boundary conditions and parameters. In a low-likelihood, high-impact storyline, under high emissions such processes could in combination contribute more than one additional meter of sea level rise by 2100. Beyond 2100, GMSL will continue to rise for centuries due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake and mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, and will remain elevated for thousands of years. Considering only processes for which projections can be made with at least medium confidence and assuming no increase in ice-mass flux after 2100, relative to the period 19952014, by 2150, GMSL will rise between 0.6 m and 1.4 m. By 2300, GMSL will rise between 0.3 m and 3.1 m under SSP1-2.6, between 1.7 m and 6.8 m under SSP5-8.5 in the absence of Marine Ice Cliff Instability, and by up to 16 m under SSP5-8.5 considering Marine Ice Cliff Instability.

Ocean acidification and deoxygenation are covered in Chapter 5 and regional changes to the ocean and cryosphere are covered in Chapter 12 and the Atlas. Ecosystem range shifts and climate risk for marine biodiversity associated with ocean change are assessed in AR6 Working Group II. The notion of climate velocity often used in impact studies, which is defined as the speed and direction at which a climate variable moves across a corresponding spatial field is underpinned by the assessment of changes in the physical characteristics of the ocean provided in this chapter. There are two major advances of this chapter compared with the AR5 and the SROCC facilitated by community efforts. The first is the temporal and spatial increase in observations of both the ocean and the cryosphere. In particular, extended observations have allowed improved assessment of past change and closure of both the energy and sea-level budget in a consistent way and the sea level budget for the last century. Higher resolution observations have revealed the details of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and globally resolved glacier changes for the first time. Improved methodology has resulted in a doubling of the assessed level of observed increase in global ocean 0200 m stratification compared to the SROCC assessment. The second advance is the use of a hierarchy of models and emulators to update projections of oceanic, cryospheric and sea-level change arising from CMIP6 and related projects.2 CMIP6 included an ice sheet modelling intercomparison for the first time. Particular modelling advances relevant to this chapter are the increase in ocean resolution in the HighResMIP and OMIP2 experiments, projections of future glacier and ice sheet response from multi-model studies, and new methods to synthesize ocean and cryosphere models into sea level projections for all SSPs and warming levels. In particular, sea level projections and the individual contributions are consistent with equilibrium climate sensitivity and surface temperature assessments across this report. There are other advances in scientific understanding.

The response time may range from a few years to a few hundred years. The glacial meltwater does not all flow immediately into the ocean: it can refreeze, feed rivers, evaporate, or be stored in lakes or closed basins. There is medium to high confidence in the understanding of processes leading to sea level contributions from glaciers. Land water storage includes surface water, soil moisture, groundwater storage and snow, but excludes water stored in glaciers and ice sheets. Changes in land water storage can be caused either by direct human intervention in the water cycle or by climate variations. Land water storage changes caused by climate variations may be indirectly affected by anthropogenic influences. It is difficult to assign a single confidence level to land water storage as understanding can vary from low confidence in groundwater recharge processes to high confidence in water storage via snowpack changes. Regional and local processes Ocean dynamic sea-level change refers to the change in mean sea level relative to the geoid and is associated with the circulation and density-driven changes in the ocean. Ocean dynamic sea-level change varies regionally but by definition has a zero global mean. It includes the depression of the sea surface by atmospheric pressure. There is medium confidence in the understanding of ocean processes leading to dynamic sea-level change. Changes in Earth Gravity, Earth Rotation and viscoelastic solid Earth Deformation result from the redistribution of mass between terrestrial ice and water reservoirs and the ocean. Contemporary terrestrial mass loss leads to elastic solid Earth uplift and a nearby relative sea-level fall. Farther away, relative sea level rises more than the global average, due, to first order, to gravitational effects. Earth deformation associated with adding water to the ocean and a shift of the Earths rotation axis towards the source of terrestrial mass loss leads to second-order effects that increase spatial variability of the pattern globally. GRD effects due to the redistribution of ocean water within the ocean itself are referred to as selfattraction and loading effects. There is high confidence in the understanding of GRD processes. Glacial Isostatic Adjustment is ongoing GRD in response to past changes in the distribution of ice and water on Earths surface. On a timescale of decades to tens of millennia following mass redistribution, Earths mantle flows viscously as it evolves toward isostatic equilibrium, causing solid Earth movement and geoid changes, which can result in regional to local sea-level variations. There is medium confidence in the understanding of glacial isostatic adjustment processes. Vertical land motion is the change in height of the land surface or the sea floor and can have several causes in addition to elastic deformation associated with contemporary GRD and viscoelastic deformation associated with glacial isostatic adjustment. Subsidence can occur through compaction of alluvial sediments in deltaic regions, removal of fluids such as gas, oil, and water, or drainage of peatlands. Tectonic deformation of the Earths crust can occur as a result of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. There is medium confidence in the understanding of vertical land motion processes."}

Relative sea-level changes affect extreme sea levels directly by shifting the mean water levels and indirectly by modulating the depth for propagation of tides, waves and/or surges. Extreme sea levels can be influenced by changes in the frequency, tracks, or strength of weather systems, or anthropogenic changes such as dredging. Extreme Still Water Level refers to the combined contribution of relative sea-level change, tides and storm surges. Wind-waves also contribute to coastal sea level.

The SROCC did not assess past SST change. Since the AR5, improvements in the understanding of recent SST biases in the observational records, especially extending ship-based observations with buoy-based observations and improved treatment of sea ice, have had important consequences for key climate change indicators such as global mean surface temperature, global mean surface air temperature, and SST. The AR5 assessment is confirmed, and it is now very likely that global mean SST changed by 0.88C from 1850-1900 to 2011-2020, and 0.60C from 1980 to 2020. Regions vary in the rate of SST warming, with slight cooling in some regions. The SROCC and Section 7.4.4 assess SST changes over specific regions, which are consistent with the changes reported here. The tropical ocean has been warming faster than other regions since 1950, with the fastest warming in regions of the tropical Indian and western Pacific Oceans, due to a combination of local atmosphere-ocean coupling, the Indonesian Throughflow, and trends in the Walker circulation. The Western Boundary Currents of the subtropical gyres have warmed faster than the global mean over the past century. There remains low agreement in the changes of both the location and the dynamical changes in western boundary current extensions. In the Arctic, the mean SST increase over the last two decades is similar to or only slightly higher than the global average. In contrast, the eastern Pacific Ocean, subpolar North Atlantic Ocean and Southern Ocean have warmed more slowly than the global average or cooled.. Surface warming in the subpolar Southern Ocean has been slower than the global average since the 1950s, and this pattern is consistent with the upwelling around Antarctica renewing surface water with pre-industrial, deeper water-masses. New evidence since the SROCC confirms slight cooling since the 1980s around the subpolar Southern Ocean, contrasting with marked warming directly northward of it. In Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems, the SROCC reported low agreement between SST trends in recent decades, due to varying spatio-temporal resolution and interannual to multidecadal variability. Satellite evidence not included in SROCC show that 92% of these regions warmed more slowly than neighbouring offshore locations between 1982-2015, so upwelling may buffer the near shore from warming. Coupled ocean-atmospheric modes of variability strongly affect regional SST. In summary, a positive SST trend since 1950 is evident globally, but there is very high confidence that the Indian Ocean, western equatorial Pacific"}

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. While AR5 and the SROCC did not assess change in mixed-layer depth, the reported changes in stratification can modulate the surface mixed layer depth, which is set by a balance between fluxes and dynamical mixing acting against the background stratification and restratification processes. Despite the large stratification increase observed at a global scale, new evidence shows that summer mixed-layer depth deepened consistently over the globe at a rate of 2.90.5% per decade from 1970 to 2018, with the largest deepening observed in the Southern Ocean, corresponding to overall deepening from 3-15 m per decade depending on region. While the shorter observational record in winter than in summer does not allow global winter mixed-layer trends to be reliably assessed, winter mixed-layer depths deepening at rates of 10 m per decade have been reported at individual long-term mid-latitude monitoring sites. Projections agree that shoaling of mixed layer depth is expected in the 21st century, but only for strong emissions scenarios and only in some regions. In summary, there is limited observational evidence that the mixed layer is globally deepening, while models show no emergence of a trend until later in the 21st century under strong emissions. The SROCC assessed that upper ocean stratification will continue to increase in the 21st century under increased radiative forcing, due to increased surface temperature and high-latitude surface freshening. New climate model simulations concur with the SROCC assessment of a future increase of the 0-200 m stratification under increased radiative forcing in all regions of the world ocean. In addition, CMIP6 climate models project a shallowing of the mixedlayer both in summer and winter by the end of the century under increased radiative forcing, with the exception of the Arctic showing deepening of the mixed-layer as a result of sea-ice retreat. The regions of largest shallowing are associated with the deepest climatological mixed layer both in winter and summer, particularly affecting the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean basins. While CMIP6 models tend to project shallowing mixed-layers under a warming climate, except at high latitudes, a deepening in the summer mixed-layer depth by intensification of the surface winds and storms may explain inconsistency among models in many regions, although model mixed layer biases are large in the summertime in the Southern Ocean. Lack of observed ocean turbulence and climate model limitations do not allow for direct assessment of ocean surface turbulence change and limit confidence in past and future mixed-layer change. Understanding of turbulent processes, its representation in ocean and climate models, and its effect on mixed layer biases have been an active and rapidly evolving topic of research since AR5. Small-scale mixed layer processes are not resolved in climate models and despite significant improvements in their parameterisation over the last decade and significant improvement in some models, biases in mixed-layer representation generally persist. In summary, the representation of upper ocean stratification and mixed layers has improved in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5. While it is virtually certain that the global mean upper ocean will continue to stratify in the 21st century, there is only low confidence in the future evolution of mixed-layer depth, which is projected to mostly shoal under high emissions scenarios except in high latitude regions where sea-ice retreats."}

In the present section, we assess the regional patterns of this warming and associated processes driving regional ocean warming. The rate of ocean warming varies regionally, with some regions having experienced slight cooling. The SROCC assessed that ocean warming in the 0-700 m is globally widespread, with slower than global average warming in the subpolar North Atlantic. The SROCC also estimated that the Southern Ocean accounted for ~75% of global ocean heat uptake during 18701995 and that 35-43% of the upper 2000 m global ocean warming occurred in the Southern Ocean over 1970-2017. The SROCC noted that this interhemispheric asymmetry might at least partially be explained by high concentrations of aerosols in the northern hemisphere. Here, we confirm these assessments, bring new evidence attributing these regional trends, and discuss the role of decadal ocean circulation variability in redistributing heat, driving interhemispheric asymmetry of the recent rate of ocean warming. Since the SROCC, one new study shows that the subpolar North Atlantic warming hole observed since the 1980s has emerged from internal climate variability and can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions. A new analysis of a suite of climate models confirms the SROCC assessment, based on one paper, attributing the observed Southern Ocean warming to anthropogenic forcing. Given the large fraction of global ocean warming in the Southern Ocean and the sparse observations there before 2005, there is limited evidence that global OHC increase since 1971 might have been underestimated. Cross-Chapter Box 9.1 accounts for an increased error before 2005 in global OHC change. In summary, in the upper 2000 m since the 1970s, the subpolar North Atlantic has been slowly warming, and the Southern Ocean has stored a disproportionally large amount of anthropogenic heat.

Below 2000 m, direct observations of full-depth ocean temperature change are limited to ship-based, highquality deep ocean temperature measurements. Such high quality full-depth ship-based sampling has improved from 1990 to the present due to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment and the Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program. The SROCC assessed that the likely warming of the ocean since the 1990s below 2000 m is associated with a marked regional pattern, with larger warming in the Southern Ocean. In the deep North Atlantic, warming has reversed to cooling over the past decade, possibly due to internal variability fed by North Atlantic Deep Water. Over the past decade, the warming rate of Antarctic Bottom Water has been dependent on origin: slower from the Weddell Sea and faster from the Ross Sea and Adelie Land.

There is still low agreement in deep ocean changes from ocean data-assimilation reanalyses and low confidence in such inferences. In summary, while observational coverage below 2000 m is sparser than in the upper 2000 m, there is high confidence that deep ocean warming below 2000 m has been larger in the Southern Ocean than in other ocean basins due to widespread AABW warming.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. Different processes drive OHC patterns over a range of timescales. Recent literature has highlighted the role of ocean circulation variability in driving OHC patterns by decomposing the global pattern of OHC change into a combination of added heat due to climate change taken up under fixed ocean circulation, and redistribution of heat associated with changing ocean currents. Redistributed heat alters regional patterns of heat storage but does not affect the global OHC. There is medium confidence that decadal variability of the ocean circulation strengthened the rate of ocean warming in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere in the decade from 2005. More generally, since 2005, the OHC pattern observed is predominantly due to heat redistribution with regions of both warming and cooling but extending analysis back to 1972 shows the importance of added heat setting a large-scale warming pattern with midlatitude maxima consistent with subduction of water masses, particularly in Southern Hemisphere Mode Waters. The longer the analysis window, the more added heat dominates over redistributed heat. This translates into more ocean area with statistically significant warming trends and less area with statistically significant cooling trends. The region where added heat is most compensated for by redistributed cooling is in the northern North Atlantic basin, where changes in the subpolar gyre circulation and AMOC result in cooling. In summary, and strengthening the SROCC assessment, ocean warming is not globally uniform due to patterns of uptake predominantly along known water mass pathways, and due to changing ocean circulation redistributing heat within the ocean.

New evidence of increasing northward OHT into the Arctic has been observed in recent decades, similar to the SROCC assessment, and consistent with observed increase in OHC in the ice free Arctic ocean. It is estimated that an increase of 0.021 PW of OHT occurred after 2001 into the Arctic, which is sufficient to account for the recent OHC change in the northern seas. However, these trends cannot yet be attributed to anthropogenic forcing due to potential internal variability. New evidence strengthens the case that ENSO and the Northern Annular Mode affect interannual OHT variability and shows that a slowing AMOC reduces northward OHT in the Atlantic at 26.5N. Despite a decrease of AMOC northward heat and mass transport, OHT has increased toward the Arctic through increased upper northern North Atlantic temperatures and stronger wind-driven gyres. In summary, OHT has increased toward the Arctic in recent decades, which at least partially explains the recent OHC change in the Arctic. Major volcanic eruptions have caused interannual to decadal cooling phases within the marked long-term increase in global OHC. In the first few years following an eruption, heat exchange with the subsurface ocean allows atmospheric cooling to be sequestered into the seasonal thermocline, therefore reducing the magnitude of the peak atmospheric temperature anomaly. However, while explosive volcanic eruptions only disturb the Earths radiative budget and surface fluxes for a few years, the ocean preserves an anomaly in OHC in the upper 500m many years after the eruption. The anomaly affects the atmosphere through air-sea heat fluxes with surface conditions returning to normal only after several decades, or on centennial time-scales in the case of repeated eruptions. In summary, there is medium confidence that oceanic mechanisms buffer the atmospheric response to volcanic eruptions on annual timescales by storing volcanic cooling in the subsurface ocean, affecting ocean heat content and thermosteric sea level on decadal to centennial timescales. CMIP5 and CMIP6 models simulate OHC changes that are consistent with the updated observational and improved estimates of OHC over the period 1960 to 2018, and they replicate the vertical partitioning of OHC change for the industrial era, although with a tendency to underestimate OHC gain shallower than 2000 m and overestimate it deeper than 2000 m. The AR5 assessed that climate models transport heat downward more than the real ocean. Since the AR5, studies have shown that increasing the horizontal resolution of ocean models tends to increase agreement of vertical heat transport with observations as the dependency on ad-hoc choices of eddy parameterizations is relaxed. The magnitude of the AMOC and Indonesian Throughflow affect future OHC change, e.g. through overestimated modelled downward heat pumping, and there are indications of greater model consistency in these transports at higher resolution. Climate models tend to reproduce the observed added heat, but redistributed heat is less well represented. Since redistributed heat dominates historical OHC change, historical simulations poorly reproduce regional patterns, but as future OHC change will become dominated"}

In summary, climate models have more skill in representing OHC change from added heat than from ocean circulation change. Since added heat dominates over redistributed heat on a centennial scale confidence in future modelled OHC patterns at the end of the 21st century is greater than at decadal scale. The SROCC assessed that the ocean will continue to take up heat in the coming decades for all plausible scenarios, and here this assessment is confirmed with very high confidence. The SROCC reported that compared with the observed changes since the 1970s, the warming of the ocean by 2100 would very likely double to quadruple for low emissions scenarios and increase 5 to 7 times for high emissions scenarios. The SROCC also concluded with high confidence that the overall warming of the ocean would continue this century even after radiative forcing and mean surface temperatures stabilize, and SROCC projected that ocean heat content in the 02000 m layer will increase from 2017 to 2100 by 0.9000.345 YJ under RCP2.6 and 2.1500.540 YJ under RCP8.5. Updating the SROCC estimates with CMIP6 projections gives heat content increases and 17-83% ranges in the 02000 m layer from 1995-2014 to 2081-2100 of 1.06 YJ, 1.35 YJ, 1.62 YJ, 1.89 YJ under scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The two-layer model used here to calculate thermosteric sea level rise and tuned for AR6-assessed ECS, provides consistent 17-83% ranges of 1.18 YJ, 1.56 YJ, 1.90 YJ, 2.23 YJ under scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP58.5, respectively. Based on both CMIP6 models and the two-layer model, it is likely that, from 1995-2014 to 2081-2100, OHC will increase 2 to 5 times the amount of the 1971-2018 OHC increase under SSP1-2.6, and 4 to 8 times that amount under SSP5-8.5. CMIP6 models show that the dependence of OHC on scenarios begins only after about 2040. The patterns of OHC projected by CMIP6 models are similar to the CMIP5 projections assessed in the SROCC: faster warming in all water mass subduction regions; deeper penetration in the centre of subtropical gyres; slower northern North Atlantic warming due to slowing AMOC; and slower subpolar Southern Ocean warming due upwelled pre-industrial water masses. Decreased aerosol forcing will allow Northern Hemisphere ocean warming to be faster and less dominated by Southern Hemisphere change. Since the SROCC, distinguishing between added and redistributed heat has aided in understanding projections. The near-term decades will feature patterns strongly influenced by heat redistribution and internal variability. Strengthening Southern Hemisphere westerlies are projected except for stringent mitigation scenarios and will cause a northward and downward OHT. There is low agreement in future Southern Ocean warming across model results due to uncertainties in the magnitude of westerly wind changes and the degree of eddy compensation of overturning across different parameterisations and resolutions. By 2100 however, the OHC change will be dominated by the added heat response, particularly for strong warming scenarios with added heat following unperturbed water mass pathways in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. There is high confidence that projected weakening of the AMOC will cause a decrease in northward OHT in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes associated with a dipole pattern of Atlantic OHC redistributed from northern to low latitudes that may override added heating in the northern North Atlantic. Variations in the degree of AMOC redistributed heat causes large intermodel spread in SST and OHC change. In the 7002000m depth range, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models project the largest warming to be in the North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water while below 2000 m, the North Atlantic cools in many models, and Antarctic Bottom Waters warm. In summary, on decadal timescales, redistribution will dominate regional patterns of OHC change without affecting the globally integrated OHC, but by 2100, particularly under strong warming scenarios, there is high confidence that regional patterns of OHC change will be dominated by added heat entering the sea surface primarily in"}

The SROCC assessed that the warming of the deep ocean is slow to manifest, with multi-century or longer response times, so global OHC will continue to rise for centuries. New studies show that this continuation persists even after cessation of greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean warming will continue even after emissions reach zero because of slow ocean circulation. Ocean heat content will increase until at least 2300 even for low emission scenarios, but with a scenario-dependent rate and depends not only on cumulative CO2 emissions, but also on the time profile of emissions. Past long-term changes in total OHC illustrate adjustment relevant to expected future changes. Observational data from ice core rare gas elemental and isotopic ratios document a rise in global OHC relative to the Last Glacial Maximum of >17,000 ZJ. This temperature increase is significantly larger than the modelled OHC changes associated with collapse of AMOC alone and tracks rising Southern Ocean SST, strengthening of the deep abyssal overturning cell and increased North Atlantic water in the Southern Ocean, underscoring the importance of Antarctic abyssal ventilation on long-term oceanic heat budgets. An ensemble of four intermediate-complexity models project 10,000-year future responses to CO2 emissions with SST change peaking around 2300 with varying scenario-dependent magnitude approaching the scale of glacial-to-interglacial changes in paleodata. Long-term OHC commitments relative 1850-1900 conditions are 2.6, 9.7, 15.2, 21.6, and 28.0 YJ for emissions of 0, 1280, 2560, and 3840 and 5120 Gt after 2000 CE respectively, with OHC peaking near 4000 CE reflecting whole-ocean warming lagging SST by thousands of years. The exact timing is uncertain subject to rates of high-latitude meltwater input and circulation time. In summary, there is high confidence that there is a long-term commitment to increased OHC in response to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which is essentially irreversible on human timescales.

The SROCC assessment was consistent with the AR5. Section 2.3.3.2 strengthens evidence that subsurface salinity trends are connected to surface trends, which are in turn linked to an intensifying"}

Large regions of the Antarctic shelves are currently isolated from warm CDW. The SROCC assessed that subsurface warming extends close to Antarctica and has co-occurred with shoaling of the CDW since the 1980s, influencing the continental shelf most in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas, Wilkes Land, and the Antarctic Peninsula. New evidence since the SROCC reinforces confidence in the importance of the role of winds in transporting heat associated with CDW to continental shelves and ice cavities in the AmundsenBellingshausen Seas and via variable small-scale undercurrents to the Shirase Glacier Tongue in East Antarctica. There is limited evidence that increased greenhouse gas forcing has caused a slight mean change of the local winds from 1920-2018 facilitating CDW heat intrusion onto the Amundsen-Bellingshausen continental shelf and ice-shelf melt. Multiple lines of observational, numerical, theoretical, and paleo evidence provide high confidence that changes in wind pattern, increased ice-shelf melt, reduction in sea-ice production, and eddies can facilitate access of CDW to the sub-ice-shelf cavities. However, there is low confidence in the quantitification, importance and the ability of present models, especially at coarse resolution, to project changes in each of these processes. Some studies have projected a possible shift from cold to warm sub-ice shelf cavities causing a sudden flush of warm water underneath ice shelves, but there is low confidence both in the driving processes and the threshold to trigger the shift. 9.2.3 Regional Ocean Circulation 9.2.3.1 Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is the main overturning current system in the South and North Atlantic Oceans. It transports warm upper-ocean water northwards, and cold, deep water southwards, as part of the global ocean circulation system. AMOC changes influence global ocean heat content and transport; global ocean anthropogenic carbon uptake changes and climate sensitivity; and dynamical sea level. Since the AR5/SROCC, confidence in modelled and reconstructed AMOC has decreased due to new observations and model disagreement. Confidence in modelled AMOC evolution during the 20th century, the magnitude of 21st century AMOC decline, and the possibility of an abrupt collapse before 2100 have been revisited. The AR5 found that the mean AMOC strength in CMIP5 models ranges from 15 to 30 Sv for the historical period. The multi-model mean overturning at 26N in CMIP5 and CMIP6 is comparable to the RAPID measurements, but the inter-model spread in CMIP6 is as large as in CMIP5 ((Weijer et al., 2020); Section 3.5.4). Biases in simulations of the present day AMOC and associated deep convection in the subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas were large in CMIP5 models with many models exhibiting ocean convection that is too deep, over too large an area, too far south and occurring too frequently related to biases in sea-ice extent, overflows, and freshwater forcing. As a result, the AMOC in CMIP5 was nearly always too shallow, with too weak a temperature contrast between the northward and southward flowing branches. Deep convection errors are still large in CMIP6 and the shallow bias in AMOC persists. Since the AR5, there is emerging evidence that enhancing horizontal resolution can reduce longstanding climate model biases in AMOC strength, where the magnitude and profile of northward heat transport at 26N become more comparable to observations. The sensitivity of the AMOC to ocean resolution, however, is model-dependent and can be positive as well as negative. An increase in AMOC strength at 26N with higher resolution in the ocean component has been associated with too strong convection in the subpolar gyre and too deep winter mixed layers, which occurs in most CMIP6 models that are unable to overflow deep water formed in the Nordic Seas across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge. Thus models with a correct AMOC strength may do so by compensating a lack of deep water outflow from the Nordic Seas through too much deep convection and deep-water formation in the Labrador and"}

In summary, the combination of observational, numerical and paleoclimate evidence provides us with medium confidence that the lower cell will continue decreasing in the 21st century as a result of increased basal melt from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. 9.2.3.3 Tropical Oceans The tropics are a tightly coupled ocean-atmosphere system with tightly interconnected basins. The zonal atmospheric Walker Circulation and the Indonesian Throughflow are key connections between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and variations in the Walker and Hadley Circulations are tightly linked to the tropical Pacific SST and currents. The tropics have a profound influence on the climate system through the multiple modes of variability they host, which have widespread global influence at seasonal to annual timescale. The effect of tropical modes of variability on climate and their long-term changes are reviewed in detail in Annex IV, while changes to the tropical ocean are assessed throughout the report and briefly summarized here. Section 2.4 concludes that a sustained shift beyond multi-centennial variability has not been observed for ENSO and that there is limited evidence and limited agreement about the long-term behaviour of other tropical modes. Section 3.7 assesses with high confidence that human influence has not affected the principal tropical modes of interannual climate variability and their associated regional teleconnections beyond the range of internal variability. Section 4.3.3.2 assesses with medium confidence that there is no consensus from models for a systematic change in the amplitude of El NinoSouthern Oscillation sea surface temperature variability over the 21st century. The related change in tropical SSTs is covered in Section 9.2.1.1. The projected changes in SST have implications for marine heat wave characteristics, which are assessed in Box 9.2. SST changes in the tropics are related to changes in the atmospheric circulation, including surface equatorial easterly trade winds and Walker Circulation, and the weakening Indonesian Throughflow and strengthening Agulhas Extension and leakage. Weakening trade winds under climate change will tend to decrease upwelling, along isopycnals in the eastern Pacific and diapycnal upwelling in the central Pacific and thus the meridional temperature gradients that drive Tropical Instability Waves, along with a weakening, flattening and shoaling of the tropical thermocline and equatorial undercurrent. A weak or absent Equatorial Undercurrent and a too diffuse and incorrectly sloped tropical thermocline remain issues in most CMIP6 models. In summary, while future changes in tropical modes of variability remain unclear, change in atmospheric and ocean circulation will drive continued change in tropical ocean temperature in the 21st century, with part of the region experiencing drastic marine heat wave conditions. 9.2.3.4 Gyres, Western Boundary Currents, and Inter-Basin Exchanges The AR5 assessed with medium to high confidence that the North Pacific subpolar gyre, the South Pacific subtropical gyre, and the subtropical cells have intensified. They also reported that the North Pacific subtropical gyre had expanded since the 1990s, and that overall the changes in gyre systems were likely predominantly due to interannual-to-decadal variability. The SROCC complemented the AR5 assessment by reporting that the polar Beaufort Gyre in the Arctic expanded to the northwest between 2003 and 2014, contemporaneous with changes in its freshwater accumulation and alterations in wind forcing. Consistent with the reported change over the gyres, both the AR5 and the SROCC reported that Western Boundary Currents have intensified, and expanded poleward, except for the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio. Section 2.3.3.4 provides an overall assessment of gyres and WBCs including an assessment of change from paleoclimate archives.

On shorter timescales, especially in extratropical coastal areas, there may be an important barotropic component due mostly to changes in wind-driven circulation and eddies apparent in the variance of ocean dynamic sea level (Figure 9.12,. This component is highly sensitive to ocean model resolution. Steric sea-level change is associated with local changes in temperature and salinity, which come about through changes in surface fluxes of heat and freshwater and through redistribution of existing water masses by changed ocean circulation and mixing processes. Redistribution of water masses often involves anticorrelated thermosteric and halosteric changes, especially in the Atlantic.

No overlay indicates regions with high model agreement, where 80% of models agree on the sign of change; diagonal lines indicate regions with low model agreement, where <80% of models agree on the sign of change. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. Ocean dynamic sea-level change is strongly affected by internal variability, partly from interannual to decadal coupled atmosphere-ocean modes of variability via wind-driven redistribution and partly from intrinsic ocean variability, particularly in higher resolution simulations, which statistically resemble observations, even on short timescales. High-resolution simulations are not used in relative sea level projections due to the limited range of forcing scenarios. The most marked feature of long-term regional sea-level change in the continuous satellite altimetry record, beginning in 1992, is the east-west dipole in the Pacific Ocean, which persisted until 2015 and can be explained by anomalously strong trade winds together with associated changes in surface heat flux. The most notable features of sub-annual variability in altimetry are eddies and tides, which are directly simulated only in high resolution models. Projections of the pattern and amplitude of regional ocean dynamic sea-level change in CMIP6 and previous model generations show a large model spread, of a similar size to the geographical spread. The model spread derives from model dependence of changes both in surface fluxes and in the ocean response. The spread is similar in CMIP6 and CMIP5, and is largest in regions with large projected variations in ensemble-mean ocean dynamic sea-level change, such as the Southern Ocean dipole with an ocean dynamic sea-level rise north of the ACC and a fall to the south, the Atlantic dipole with a sea-level rise north of 40oN and a fall in 20-40oN, the north-west Pacific dipole, and the large sea-level rise in the Arctic. Patterns of change are consistent between model simulations and observations. The major model ensemble-mean features resemble thermosteric sea level change, as expected from altered input of heat to the ocean without changing circulation, while model spread results from the diversity in redistribution of the heat content of the unperturbed ocean (Section 9.2.2.1; (Bouttes and Gregory, 2014; Gregory et al., 2016;"}

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. The SROCC discussed the regional distribution of Arctic sea-ice loss and their findings remain valid for the updated time series covering 2019. Sea-ice loss in winter is strongest in the Barents Sea, while summer losses occur primarily at the summer sea-ice region margins, in particular in the East Siberian, Chukchi, Kara and Beaufort Seas. In the Bering Sea, expanding winter sea-ice cover was observed until 2017, but a marked reduction in sea-ice concentration has occurred since then(high confidence). With respect to seasonal changes in the sea-ice cover, the winter sea-ice loss causes a decrease in the average sea-ice age and fraction of multi-year ice as assessed by the SROCC, and also of the ocean area covered intermittently by sea ice. In contrast, the seasonal ice zone has expanded regionally and over the whole Arctic, because the loss of summer sea-ice area is larger than the loss of winter sea-ice area. Arctic sea ice retreat includes an earlier onset of surface melt in spring and a later freeze up in fall, lengthening the open-water season in the seasonal sea-ice zone. However, there is low agreement in quantification of regional trends of melt and freeze onset between different observational products. Reconstructions of Arctic sea-ice coverage put the satellite period changes into centennial context. Direct observational data coverage and model reconstructions warrant high confidence that the low Arctic sea-ice area of summer 2012 is unprecedented since 1850, and that the summer sea-ice loss is significant in all Arctic regions except for the Central Arctic. Direct wintertime observational data coverage before 1953 is too sparse to reliably assess Arctic sea-ice area. Since 1953, the years 2015 to 2018 had the four lowest values of maximum Arctic sea-ice area, which usually occurs in March. Reconstructions of Arctic sea-ice area before 1850 remain sparse, and as in the SROCC, there remains medium confidence that the current sea-ice levels in late summer are unique during the past 1 kyr. The observed fluctuations and trends of the Arctic sea-ice cover arise from a combination of changes in natural external forcing and anthropogenic forcing, internal variability and internal feedbacks. New paleo-proxy techniques indicate regional sea-ice changes over epochs and millennia and allow possible drivers to be assessed.

These records and other proposed paleo proxies including bromine in ice cores, dinocyst assemblages and driftwood provide evidence of sea-ice fluctuations that exceed internal variability. The inferred sea-ice fluctuations over millennia can be related to Northern-hemisphere temperature evolution and give rise to Arctic-wide fluctuations in sea-ice coverage in the paleo record. On a regional scale, fluctuations include decreased sea-ice cover during the Allerd warm period in the Laptev and Bering Sea; an extensive sea-ice cover during the Younger Dryas in the Bering, Kara, Laptev and Barents Seas and at the Yermak Plateau; little sea ice during the early Holocene, when Northern hemisphere summer insolation was higher than today, in the North Icelandic Shelf area, Sea of Okhotsk, Canadian Arctic, Barents, Bering, and Chukchi Seas, at the Yermak Plateau and north of Greenland; increasing sea-ice cover throughout much of the middle and late Holocene around Svalbard, in the North Icelandic Shelf area, north of Greenland, and in the Western Greenland, Barents, Chukchi and Laptev Seas. The consistent, Arctic-wide changes give high confidence in millennial-scale co-variability of the sea-ice cover with temperature fluctuation. The SROCC assessed that approximately half of the satellite-observed Arctic summer sea ice loss is driven by increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Recent attribution studies now allow the strengthened assessment that it is very likely that more than half of the observed Arctic sea-ice loss in summer is anthropogenic. This assessment is confirmed by process-based analyses of Arctic sea-ice loss not assessed by the SROCC. Similar to the paleo record, the satellite record of Arctic sea-ice area from 1979 onwards is strongly linearly correlated with global mean temperature on decadal and longer time scales . The correlation holds across all months with R2 ranging from 0.61 to 0.81. However, in contrast to paleo-records, sea-ice fluctuations during the satellite period are only weakly correlated with Northern Hemisphere insolation; modern Northern Hemisphere sea-ice area is more strongly correlated with atmospheric CO2 concentration and cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions. R2 values of the correlation between sea-ice area and cumulative CO2 emissions range across all months from 0.76 to 0.92. In summary, there is high confidence that satellite-observed Arctic sea-ice area is strongly correlated with global mean temperature, CO2 concentration and cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In addition to changes in the external forcing, internal variability substantially affects Arctic sea ice, evidenced from both paleo records (e.g.,) and satellites after 1979. Most of the internal variability on annual time scales is related to atmospheric temperature fluctuations, for example linked to cyclone activities, while multidecadal internal variability is primarily related to changes in oceanic heat transport. These mechanisms are represented in current climate models, but the resulting internal variability of September sea-ice area in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, as given by the ensemble mean standard deviation s SIA,Sep=0.5 million km2, exceeds the estimated internal variability for the period 1850 to 1979 from both reanalyses and direct observational reconstructions. Internal variability has been estimated to have contributed 30 to 50% of the observed Arctic summer sea-ice loss since 1979. However, this estimate from models might be biased towards internal over forced variability"}

Most CMIP6 models fail to simulate the observed sensitivity of sea-ice loss to CO2 emissions and to temperature simultaneously. However, they better capture the observed sensitivity of sea-ice loss to CO2 emissions than CMIP5 models (Section 3.4.1, Figure 9.14h;). The SROCC examined the different atmospheric and oceanic processes that caused the observed sea-ice loss, with recent studies providing new evidence for the importance of variations in air temperature, wind patterns, oceanic heat flux and riverine heat influx. As in the SROCC, the relative contribution of each physical cause to the sea-ice loss cannot be robustly quantified because of disagreement among models, sparse observations and limited understanding of the variation of each factor with global mean temperature. This is addressed by new diagnostics available from CMIP6 simulations, which now allow for more detailed analyses of the drivers of sea-ice loss at a process level. In examining temperature thresholds for the loss of Arctic summer sea ice, the SR1.5 and the SROCC assess that a reduction of September-mean sea-ice area to below 1 million km2, practically a sea-ice-free Arctic Ocean, is more probable for a global mean warming of 2C compared to global mean warming of 1.5C. Analyses of CMIP6 simulations confirm this result, as they show that on decadal and longer time scales, Arctic summer sea ice area will remain highly correlated with global mean temperature until the summer sea ice has vanished. Quantitatively, existing studies additionally show that for a warming between 1.5 and 2  C, the Arctic will only be practically sea-ice free in September in some years, while at 3  C warming the Arctic is practically sea-ice free in September in most years, with longer practically sea-ice-free periods at higher warming levels. However, because of the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models generally too low sensitivity of sea-ice loss to global warming, there is only low confidence regarding the specific warming level at which the Arctic Ocean first becomes practically sea-ice free. Figure 9.14: Monthly mean March and September sea-ice area as a function of global surface air temperature anomaly; cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions; year in CMIP6 model simulations and in observations. Panels d and h show the sensitivity of sea-ice loss to anthropogenic CO2 emissions as a function of the modelled sensitivity of GSAT to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In panels d and h, the black dot denotes the observed sensitivity, while the shading around it denotes internal variability as inferred from CMIP6 simulations. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. In contrast, CMIP6 models capture the observed sensitivity of Arctic sea ice area to cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions well, providing high confidence that the Arctic Ocean will likely become practically sea-ice free in the September mean for the first time for future CO2 emissions of less than 1000 Gt and before the year 2050 in all SSP scenarios. This new assessment is consistent with an observation-based projection of a practically sea-ice free Arctic Ocean in September for additional anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 800 330 GtCO2 beyond the year 2018. This estimate may, however, be too high due to neglecting possible future reduction in atmospheric aerosol load that would cause additional warming and is subject to the same constraints as the carbon budget analysis for global mean temperature.

There is indication that CMIP6 simulations of Arctic sea ice have improved relative to CMIP5, but detailed evaluation studies exist mainly for CMIP5 models. These studies found that CMIP5 model projections and reanalyses show a large spread of simulated regional Arctic sea-ice concentration, which remains true for CMIP6 models. In addition, both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show a large spread in the simulated seasonal cycle of Arctic sea-ice area, with too high a sea-ice area in March in the ensemble mean. CMIP5 models also have been found to have difficulty simulating realistic landfast sea ice. These findings imply that both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models do not realistically capture the regional and seasonal processes governing observed Arctic sea-ice evolution, causing low confidence in the models projections of future regional sea-ice evolution, including updated projections for shipping routes across the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage. CMIP5 models also have issues with capturing the seasonal cycle of observed changes in Arctic sea-ice drift speed, which affects their simulation of regional sea-ice concentration patterns. Direct measurements of Arctic sea ice from drift buoys and satellites show that drift speed of Arctic sea ice has increased over the satellite period in all seasons. In summer, CMIP5 models show a slowdown of Arctic sea-ice drift rather than the observed acceleration. In winter, CMIP5 models generally capture the observed acceleration of Arctic drift speed. The drift acceleration is primarily caused by the decrease in concentration and thickness, both in the observational record and, for winter, in CMIP5 models. Changes in wind speed are less important for the observed large-scale changes. In summary, there is high confidence that Arctic sea-ice drift has accelerated because of the decrease in sea ice concentration and thickness. The SR1.5 assessed with high confidence that there is no hysteresis in the loss of Arctic summer sea ice. In addition, there is no tipping point or critical threshold in global mean temperature beyond which the loss of summer sea ice becomes self-accelerating and irreversible. This is because stabilizing feedbacks during winter related to increased heat loss through thin ice and thin snow, and increased emission of longwave radiation from open water, dominate over the amplifying ice-albedo feedback. Observed and modelled Arctic summer sea ice and global mean temperature are linked with little temporal delay, and the summer sea-ice loss is reversible on decadal time scales. The loss of winter sea ice is reversible as well, but the loss of winter sea-ice area per degree of warming in CMIP5 and CMIP6 projections increases as the ice retreats from the continental shore lines, because these limit the possible areal fluctuations. 9.3.1.2 Arctic Sea-Ice volume and thickness The SROCC assessed with very high confidence that Arctic sea ice has become thinner over the satellite period from 1979 onwards, and this assessment is confirmed for the updated time series. Sea-ice area has also decreased substantially over this period, leading to the assessment that Arctic sea-ice volume has also decreased with very high confidence over the satellite period since 1979. There is, however, only low confidence in quantitative estimates of the sea-ice volume loss over this period because of a lack of reliable, long-term, pan-Arctic observations and substantial spread in available reanalyses. Current best estimates from reanalyses suggest a reduction of September Arctic sea ice volume of 55 to 65 % over the period 1979 to 2010, and of about 72 % over the period 1979 to 2016, with the latter deemed a conservative estimate. For the more recent past, ice-thickness can be directly estimated from satellite estimates of sea-ice freeboard. Based on these retrievals, there is medium confidence that"}

There is low confidence in the amount of decrease over this period and over the CryoSat-2 period from 2011 onwards primarily because of snow-induced uncertainties in the retrieval algorithms, the shortness of the record, and the small identified trend (e.g.,). Observations of regional changes in sea-ice thickness vary in quality. Analysis of submarine data in the central Arctic Ocean suggests that sea ice there has thinned by about 75 cm compared to the mid-1970s. For smaller regions, data are too sparse to allow for quantitative estimates of long-term trends, but a clear thinning signal over 10 to 20 years has been found for sea ice in Fram Strait, north of Canada and for landfast ice in Kongsfjorden/Svalbard. CMIP5 models and reanalyses fail to capture the observed distribution and evolution of Arctic sea-ice thickness. Most CMIP6 models do not capture the observed spatial distribution of sea-ice thickness realistically. This leads to low confidence in estimates of thickness from reanalyses and from CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, and in these models projections of sea-ice volume. 9.3.2 Antarctic Sea Ice 9.3.2.1 Antarctic sea-ice coverage The SROCC assessed that there was no significant trend in annual mean Antarctic sea-ice area over the period of reliable satellite retrievals starting in 1979. The updated time series is consistent with this assessment. It includes a maximum sea-ice area in 2014, a substantial decline from then until the minimum sea-ice area in 2017, and an increase in sea-ice area since then. As assessed in Section 2.3.2.1.2, the possible significance of the increase in mean Antarctic sea-ice area over the shorter period 1979 to 2014 is unclear. This is because of observational uncertainty, large year-to-year fluctuations in all months, and limited understanding of the processes and reliability of year-to-year correlation of Antarctic sea-ice area. As assessed by the SROCC, the evolution of mean Antarctic sea-ice area is the result of opposing regional trends, with slightly decreasing sea-ice cover during the period 1979 to 2019 in the Amundsen Sea and the Bellingshausen Sea, particularly during summer, and slightly increasing sea-ice cover in the eastern parts of the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea. With the exception of the Ross Sea, these trends are not significant considering the large variability of the time series. The SROCC assessed that the regional trends are closely related to meridional wind trends. This is the case as the regional trends in the maximum northward extent of the ice cover are determined by the balance between the northward advection of the ice that is formed in polynyas near the continental margin, and the lateral and subsurface melting through oceanic heat fluxes. The advection of the sea ice is strongly correlated with winds and cyclones. Accordingly, the increasing sea-ice area in the Ross Sea can be linked to a strengthening of the Amundsen Sea low (e.g.,), while other regional sea-ice trends in the austral fall can be linked to changes in westerly winds, cyclone activity and the Southern Annular Mode in summer and spring. In addition to the wind-driven changes, increased near-surface ocean stratification has contributed to the observed increase in sea-ice coverage (e.g.,) as it tends to cool the surface ocean. The changes in stratification result partly from surface freshening (associated with increased northward sea-ice advection and/or melting of the Antarctic ice sheet (e.g.,)) and are amplified by local ice-ocean feedbacks. In the Amundsen Sea, strong ice-shelf melting can cause local sea-ice melt next to the ice-shelf front by entraining warm Circumpolar Deep Water to the ice-shelf cavity"}

It has also been suggested that the observed regional increase in sea ice coverage since 1979 results from a long-term Southern Ocean surface cooling trend (e.g.,) but the importance of this mechanism for the observed sea-ice evolution is unclear owing to intricate feedbacks between sea-ice change and surface cooling. The importance of changing wave activity on sea ice is unclear due to limited process understanding. In summary, there is high confidence that regional Antarctic trends are primarily caused by changes in sea-ice drift and decay, with medium confidence in a dominating role of changing wind pattern. The precise relative contribution of individual drivers remains uncertain because of limited observations, disagreement between models, unresolved processes, and temporal and spatial remote linkages caused by sea-ice drift (Section 9.2.3.2,). Recent research has confirmed the SROCC assessment of atmospheric and oceanic drivers of the sea-ice decline from 2014 to 2017, which can be linked to changes in both subsurface ocean heat flux and atmospheric circulation, with the latter partly related to teleconnections with the tropics. In the Weddell Sea, these changes caused in 2017 the re-emergence of the largest polynya over the Maud Rise since the 1970s. Figure 9.15: Antarctic sea-ice historical records and CMIP6 projections.

Fourth column: number of available CMIP6 models that simulate a mean sea-ice concentration above 15 % for the decade 2045-2054. The average observational record of sea-ice area is derived from the UHH sea-ice area product, based on the average sea-ice concentration of OSISAF/CCI(Lavergne et al., 2019), NASA Team(Cavalieri et al., 1996) and Bootstrap(Comiso, 2017) that is also used for the figure panels showing observed sea-ice concentration. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. The AR5 and the SROCC found low confidence in future projections of Antarctic sea ice. This includes the projected mitigation of the sea-ice loss by stratospheric ozone recovery and by an increased freshwater input from melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. Compared to the interannual variability during the satellite record from 1979 onwards, models simulate too much variability both in CMIP5 and in CMIP6. The seasonal cycle in sea-ice coverage is misrepresented in most CMIP5 (e.g.,) and CMIP6 models, but the multi-model mean seasonal cycle in CMIP5 and CMIP6 agrees well with observations. Most CMIP5 models do not realistically simulate the evolution of Antarctic sea-ice volume and consistently overestimate the amount of low concentration sea ice and underestimate the amount of high concentration sea ice. CMIP6 models, in contrast, simulate a more realistic distribution of regional sea-ice coverage. Most CMIP5 models poorly represent Antarctic sea-ice drift (e.g.,), affecting simulated historical trends, with models that simulate a strong sea-ice motion showing more variability in sea-ice coverage than models with weaker sea-ice motion.

The discrepancy between the modelled and observed evolution of Antarctic sea ice has been related by the SROCC to deficiencies in stratification, freshening by ice shelf melt water, clouds, and other wind and ocean driven processes. Recent studies highlight the possible mis-representation of freshwater fluxes from ice shelves, and the possible effect of the low resolution of most models, even though lower-resolution models are in principle capable of a realistic simulation of the seasonal sea-ice budgets in the Southern Ocean. The relative importance of these possible reasons for model-shortcomings remains unclear. The analysis and understanding of the long-term evolution of the Antarctic sea-ice cover is hindered by the scarcity of observational records before the satellite period and the scarcity of paleo records. Such long records are particularly relevant given that the Southern Ocean response to external forcing takes longer than the length of the available direct observational record. There is only limited evidence for large-scale decadal fluctuations in sea-ice coverage caused by large-scale temperature and wind forcing. Sparse direct pre-satellite observations suggest a decrease in sea-ice coverage from the 1950s to the 1970s. Paleoproxy data indicate that, on multi-decadal to multi-centennial time scales, sea-ice coverage of the Southern Ocean follows large-scale temperature trends (e.g.,), for example linked to fluctuations in the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode, and that during the Last Glacial Maximum Antarctic sea ice extended to about the polar front latitude in most regions during winter, whereas the extent during summer is less well understood (e.g.,). Regionally, proxy data from ice cores consistently indicate that the increase of sea-ice area in the Ross Sea and the decrease of sea-ice area in the Bellingshausen Sea are part of longer centennial trends and exceed internal variability on multi-decadal time-scales (e.g.,). These centennial trends are consistent with simulations from CMIP5 models. There is low confidence in the attribution of the observed changes in Antarctic sea-ice area. Based on the available evidence, the lack of a negative trend of Antarctic sea-ice area despite substantial global warming in recent decades has been attributed to internal variability in analyses of the observational record, reconstructions from early observations and proxy data, and model simulations. Nonetheless, without accurate simulations of observed changes, the possible contribution of anthropogenic forcing to the regional changes in sea-ice area remains unclear The attribution of the observed trends in atmospheric and oceanic forcing is also uncertain because of limited observational records and discrepancies between modelled and observed evolution of the sea-ice cover. More specifically, there is contrasting evidence for a direct role of stratospheric ozone depletion on the observed changes in atmospheric circulation. In contrast, there is high confidence that multi-decadal variations in the tropical Pacific and in the Atlantic affect the Amundsen Sea low, while other modes of climate variability affect, for example, Southern Ocean cyclone activity. 9.3.2.2 Antarctic sea-ice thickness The SROCC assessed that observations are too sparse to reliably estimate long-term trends in Antarctic seaice thickness.

Regional patterns in ice thickness are affected by large snow deposition and resulting snow-ice formation, and deformation, ridging, and rafting that regionally cause formation of very thick sea ice. In addition, near ice shelves a sub-ice platelet layer from supercooled water can significantly increase sea-ice thickness. Regarding snow thickness, observations are too sparse in space and time to reliably estimate changes across Southern Ocean sea ice. There is low confidence in the long-term trend of Antarctic sea-ice thickness. Both ASPeCt and ICESat-1 measurements are biased low in regions with thick ice, compared to results from reanalyses and observations with autonomous vehicles under sea ice. Estimates of sea-ice thickness from Cryosat-2 do not substantially reduce uncertainty, primarily because of the unknown snow thickness and radar scattering above the snowice interface. Isolated in-situ time series show no clear long-term trend in landfast ice thickness in the Weddell Sea. Reanalyses suggest overall increasing sea-ice thickness and volume between 1980 and 2010, while CMIP5 and CMIP6 models simulate a decrease in Antarctic sea-ice volume over the historical period. Because of this discrepancy, and the unclear reliability of the reanalyses, there is low confidence in CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulated future Antarctic sea-ice thickness. 9.4 Ice Sheets 9.4.1 Greenland Ice Sheet 9.4.1.1 Recent observed changes In this section we present regional mass change time series for the Greenland Ice Sheet and assess the different processes causing the increase in mass loss. The vast increase in observational products from various platforms provide a consistent and clear picture of a shrinking Greenland Ice Sheet. Section 2.3.2.4.1 provides an updated estimate of the total Greenland Ice Sheet mass change in a global context. A paleo perspective on Greenland Ice Sheet evolution is presented in Section 9.6.2 with estimated ice sheet extent at different times shown in Figure 9.17. For the 20th century, the SROCC presented one reconstruction for 1900-1983 and estimated mass change for the Greenland Ice Sheet and its peripheral glaciers for the period 1901-1990. Since the SROCC, a comprehensive new study has extended the satellite record back to 1972. The rate of change of ice sheet mass was positive in 1972-1980 and then negative in 1980-1990 and 1990-2000, respectively. Other ice discharge time series starting in 1985 agree with. There is limited evidence of temporally and spatially heterogeneous Greenland outlet glacier evolution during 20th century. Historical photographs show large mass losses of Jakobshavn and Kangerlussuaq glaciers in West Greenland from 1880 until the 1940s, exceeding their 21st century mass loss, whereas the Helheim Glacier in East Greenland remained stable, gained mass in the 1990s then rapidly lost mass after 2000. Together, these 3 large outlet glaciers, draining ~12% of the ice sheet surface area, have lost 223 Gt yr-1 in the period 1880-2012. Overall, these studies provide a variable picture of the Greenland Ice Sheet mass change in the 20th"}

The updated mass loss of Greenland Ice Sheet including peripheral glaciers for period 1901-1990 is 120 Gt yr-1. Post-1992, the SROCC stated that it is extremely likely that the rate of mass change of Greenland Ice Sheet was more negative during 2012-2016 than during 1992-2001, with very high confidence that summer melting has increased since the 1990s to a level unprecedented over at least the last 350 years. Since the SROCC, the updated synthesis of satellite observations by the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise and the GRACE Follow-On Mission, have confirmed the mass change record and the record has been extended to 2020 as presented in 2.3.2.4.. The Greenland Ice Sheet lost 4890 Gt of ice between 1992 and 2020, causing sea level to rise by 13.5 mm. The IMBIE Team estimates are consistent with other post-AR5 reviews. Recent GRACE-FO data show that after two cold summers in 2017 and 2018, with relatively moderate mass change of about -100 Gt yr-1, the 2019 mass change was the largest annual mass loss in the record.

While these estimates have been confirmed since the SROCC, the new longer record, as well as further comprehensive studies and detailed discharge records reveal a more complex picture than the continuous trajectory this statement may have implied. Discharge was relatively constant from 1972-1999, varying by around 6% for the whole ice sheet, while SMB varied by over a factor of two interannually, leading to either mass gain or loss in a given year. During 2000-2005, the rate of discharge increased by 18%, then remained fairly constant again. After 2000, SMB decreased more rapidly than discharge increased. In summary, the consistent temporal pattern in these longer datasets leads to high confidence that the Greenland Ice Sheet mass losses are increasingly dominated by SMB, but there is high confidence that mass loss varies strongly, due to large interannual variability in SMB. On a regional scale, the surface elevation is lowering in all regions, and widespread terminus and calving front retreats have been observed.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. The SROCC stated with high confidence that variability in large-scale atmospheric circulation is an important driver of short-term SMB changes for the Greenland Ice Sheet. This effect of atmospheric circulation variability on both precipitation and melt rates is confirmed by more recent publications. The strong mass loss in 2019 was driven by highly anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns, both on daily and seasonal timescales. Although surface melt is anticorrelated with the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index, especially in West Greenland, Greenland Ice Sheet melt is more strongly correlated with the Greenland Blocking Index than with the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index. The SROCC did not assess the role of cloud changes in detail. Studies since the AR5 have shown that higher incident shortwave radiation in conjunction with reduced cloud cover leads to increased melt rates, particularly over the low albedo ablation zone in the southern part of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Conversely, an increase in cloud cover over the high-albedo central parts of the ice sheet, leading to higher downwelling longwave radiation, was shown to lead either to increased melt or reduced refreezing of meltwater. The elevation dependence of the cloud radiative effect and its control on surface meltwater generation and refreezing can induce a spatially consistent response of the integrated"}

The shortand longwave radiation effects on surface melt by clouds have been shown to compensate for each other during events of strong atmospheric rivers and the increase in melt is caused by increased sensible heat fluxes during such events. In summary, there is medium confidence that cloud cover changes are an important driver of the increasing melt rates in the southern and western part of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The SROCC stated with high confidence that positive albedo feedbacks contributed substantially to the post1990s Greenland Ice Sheet melt increase. Several, mostly positive, feedbacks involving surface albedo operate on ice sheets. Melt amplification by the observed increase of bare ice exposure through snowline migration to higher parts of the ice sheet since 2000 was five times stronger than the effect of hydrological and biological processes that lead to reduced bare ice albedo. Impurities, in part biologically active, have been observed to lead to albedo reduction and are estimated to have increased runoff from bare ice in the south-western sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet by about 10%. In summary, new studies confirm that there is high confidence that the Greenland Ice Sheet melt increase since about 2000 has been amplified by positive albedo feedbacks, with the expansion of bare-ice extent being the dominant factor, and albedo in the bare-ice zone being primarily controlled by distributed biologically active impurities (see also Section 7.3.4.3. The SROCC reported with medium confidence that around half of the 1960-2014 Greenland Ice Sheet surface meltwater ran off, while most of the remainder infiltrated firn and snow, where it either refroze or accumulated in firn aquifers. Studies since SROCC show a decrease of firn air content between 1998-2008 and 2010-2017 in the low-accumulation percolation area of western Greenland, reducing meltwater retention capacity. Moreover, meltwater infiltration into firn can be strongly limited by low-permeability ice slabs created by refreezing of infiltrated meltwater. Recent observations and modelling efforts indicate that rapidly expanding low-permeability layers have led to an increase in runoff area since 2001. In summary, there is medium confidence that meltwater storage and refreezing can temporarily buffer a large-scale melt increase but limiting factors have been identified. The SROCC reported that there was medium confidence that ocean temperatures near the grounding zone of tidewater glaciers are critically important to their calving rate, but there was low confidence in understanding their response to ocean forcing. The increase in ice discharge in the late 1990s and early 2000s has been associated with a period of widespread tidewater glacier retreat and speed up. Since the SROCC, new studies provide strong evidence for rapid submarine melting at tidewater glaciers. Changes in submarine melting and subglacial meltwater discharge can trigger increased ice discharge by reducing the buttressing to ice flow and promoting calving; through undercutting and frontal incision. Warming ocean waters have been implicated in the recent thinning and breakup of floating ice tongues in northeastern and northwestern Greenland. On decadal timescales, tidewater glacier terminus position correlates with submarine melting. Over shorter timescales, individual glaciers or clusters of glaciers can behave differently and asynchronously, and there are not always clear associations between water temperature and glacier calving rates, retreat or speedup. Variations in ice melange at the front of a glacier, associated with changes in ocean and air temperature, have also emerged as a plausible control on calving. In summary, there is high confidence that warmer ocean waters and increased subglacial discharge of surface melt at the margins of marine-terminating glaciers increase submarine melt, which leads to increased ice discharge, and medium confidence that this contributed to the increased rate of mass loss from Greenland particularly in the period 2000-2010 when increased discharge was observed in the southeast and northwest."}

Accurate bathymetry is essential for both establishing which water masses enter glacial fjords and for reliable estimates of the submarine melt rates experienced by tidewater glaciers. Subglacial and lateral topography is known to strongly modulate tidewater glacier dynamics and the sensitivity of tidewater glaciers to climatic forcing. Bathymetric mapping around the ice sheet has greatly improved with direct and gravimetric surveys leading to the improvement of Greenland-wide bathymetric and topographic mapping. However, large uncertainties in ice thickness remain for around half of the outlet glaciers and sea-ice covered and iceberg-packed regions remain poorly sampled near glacier termini. There is high confidence that bathymetry and fjord geometry and bedrock topography modulate the response of individual glaciers to climate forcing. The AR5 assessed that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing contributed to the surface melting of Greenland since 1993. Section 3.4.3.2 assesses that it is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades, and there is medium confidence of an anthropogenic contribution to recent mass loss from Greenland. 9.4.1.2 Model evaluation The SROCC stated that substantial challenges remained for modelling of both the Greenland surface mass balance and the dynamical ice sheet. Since the SROCC, further insights into modelling of the Greenland ice sheet has come from model intercomparison studies of both the surface mass balance and dynamical ice sheets. Further aspects relevant to the forcing of the ice sheet from large scale global climate models and regional climate models are discussed in Box 9.3 and Section Atlas.11.2. The SROCC stated that climate model simulations of Greenland surface mass balance had improved since the AR5 giving medium confidence in the ability of climate models to simulate changes in Greenland SMB. Since the SROCC, a multi-model intercomparison study of regional and global climate models has shown that the greatest inter-model spread occurs in the ablation zone, due to deficiencies in an accurate model representation of the ablation zone extent and processes related to surface melt and runoff, confirming the SROCC statement that bare-ice model uncertainty is large. This intercomparison showed that simple, well-tuned SMB models using positive degree-day melt schemes can perform as well as more complex physically-based models. Furthermore, the ensemble-mean of the models produced the best estimate of the present-day SMB relative to observations. Further assessment of Greenland ice sheet regional SMB can be found in Section Atlas 11.2.3. Recent progress confirms the SROCC assessment that there is medium confidence in the ability of climate models to simulate changes in Greenland SMB. The SROCC noted increased use of coupled climate-ice sheet models for simulating the Greenland ice sheet, but also that remaining deficiencies in coupling between models of climate and ice sheets limited the adequate representation of the feedbacks between them. Some Earth System Models now incorporate multi-layer snow models and full energy balance models or use elevation classes to compensate for their coarser resolution. Resulting SMB simulations compare better with Regional Climate Models and observations, but remaining shortcomings lead to problems reproducing a present-day ice sheet state close to observations. In summary, there is medium confidence in quantitative simulations of the present-day state of the Greenland ice sheet in ESMs. The SROCC stated that there is low confidence in understanding coastal glacier"}

Ice-ocean interactions remain poorly understood and difficult to model, with parameterizations often used for calving of marine-terminating glaciers and submarine and plume-driven melt. Due to the difficulties of modelling the large number of marine-terminating glaciers and limited availability of highresolution bedrock data, the majority of recent modelling work on Greenland outlet glaciers is focused on individual or a limited number of glaciers, or a specific region. Since the SROCC, using a flowline model that includes calving and submarine melting, Beckmann et al. concluded that the AR5 upscaling of contributions from four of the largest glaciers overestimated the total glacier contribution from the Greenland ice sheet, due to differences in response between large and small glaciers. The regional study of Morlighem et al. confirms that ice-ocean interactions have the potential to trigger extensive glacier retreat over decadal timescales as indicated by observations. A focus in continental ice sheet models has been the improved treatment of marine-terminating glaciers via inclusion of calving processes and freely moving calving fronts. An improved bedrock topographic dataset allows for ice discharge to be better captured for outlet glaciers in continental ice sheet models and simulations indicate that bedrock topography controls the magnitude and rate of retreat. Overall, although there is high confidence that the dynamic response of Greenland outlet glaciers is controlled by bedrock topography, there is low confidence in quantification of future mass loss from Greenland triggered by warming ocean conditions due to limitations in current understanding of ice-ocean interactions, its implementation in ice sheet models, and knowledge of bedrock topography. The SROCC noted the progress made in Greenland Ice Sheet models since the AR5. New since the SROCC is a focus on improved representation of the present-day state of the ice sheet. Improvements are closely linked to the growing number and quality of observations, new techniques to generate internally consistent input data sets, wider use of data assimilation techniques, increased model resolution and tuning of key processes such as calving. A remaining challenge is low confidence in reproducing historical mass changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, there is medium confidence in ice sheet models reproducing the present state of the Greenland Ice Sheet leading to medium confidence in current ability to accurately project its future evolution. 9.4.1.3 Projections to 2100 The AR5 and the SROCC projected that changes in Greenland surface mass balance will contribute to sea level in 2100 by 0.03 m SLE under RCP2.6 and 0.07 m SLE under RCP8.5. New since the SROCC are projections of SMB obtained by an Earth system model, two regional climate models, and reconstructions based on temperature from the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles. The range of sea level contribution from Greenland surface mass balance in Noel et al. are comparable to the AR5 assessment when either CMIP5 or CMIP6 models are used while Hofer et al., find a greater mass loss across all CMIP6 emission scenarios when compared to CMIP5 scenarios. Using SSP5-8.5 instead of RCP8.5 increases the mean projected sea level from 2005-2100 by up to 0.06 m in the regional climate model simulations of Hofer et al., who attribute the difference mainly to a greater Arctic amplification and associated cloud and sea ice feedbacks in the CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 simulations. In summary, these new projections with fixed ice sheet topography do not provide sufficient evidence to change the AR5 and SROCC assessment. Reviewing modelling studies since the AR5, the SROCC assessed Greenlands contribution to future sea level to be relatively similar to the AR5. The baseline for projections has shifted from 1986-2005, in the SROCC, to 1995-2014 in this report. Adjusted to the new 1995-2014 baseline by subtracting 0.01 m, the SROCC projected a likely contribution of 0.07 (0.03"}

Since the SROCC, new projections for the 21st century have included dynamic ice sheets coupled to Earth system models or regional atmospheric models. The coupled ESM-ice sheet CESM2-CISM2 model projects a sea level rise of 0.109 m in 2100 relative to 2015 under SSP5-8.5 and a similar contribution under the idealized 1% yr-1 increase in CO2 scenario. The CESM2-CISM2 simulations include ice sheetatmosphere interactions and ice sheet surface meltwater is routed to the ocean. The coupled regional atmospheric model and ice sheet model projects a sea level rise of 0.079 m in 2100 relative to 2000 under RCP8.5. An Earth System model of lower complexity coupled to an ice sheet model gives a sea level contribution of 0.025 to 0.064 m under RCP2.6 and 0.056 to 0.12 m under RCP8.5. Van Breedam et al., identify a simulation with a preferred parameter set, that projects 0.034 m for RCP2.6and 0.073 m for RCP8.5 Although the ocean does not directly force the ice sheet models in these simulations, the new coupled models allow for interactions between ice sheet dynamics, surface mass balance and local climate. The coupled projections fall within the lower bounds of the AR5 and the SROCC, and as these studies do not prescribe ocean forcing directly, it is possible that the dynamic response is underestimated. Since the SROCC, projections of the Greenland Ice Sheet are also now available from ISMIP6. The ISMIP6 multi-model projections are corrected with an assessment of the historical dynamical response to pre-2015 climate forcing. For the period 20152100, the ISMIP6 uncorrected multi-model ensemble projects a sea level contributions ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 m under RCP2.6, 0.04 to 0.14 m under RCP8.5, 0.02 to 0.06 m under SSP1-2.6 and 0.08 to 0.25 m under SSP5-8.5(Table 9.2). The higher mass loss in the SSPs is attributed to a larger decrease in SMB due to the high climate sensitivity of the models used. This finding is confirmed by, where CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 SMB leads to larger ice loss than CMIP5 RCP8.5 while ice discharge is similar. As the ISMIP6 framework considers a subset of the RCPs/SSPs and CMIP models, SSP-based projections have been inferred from multiple approaches. First, the ISMIP6 CMIP5-forced and CMIP6-forced combined ensemble projections were corrected with the historical trend using bootstrapping. Second, an emulator of the ISMIP6 projections is forced by distributions of global surface air temperature for each SSP from a two-layer energy budget emulator and then corrected with the historical trend in the same way. These two approaches result in projections that are similar in their median values to the AR5 and SROCC projections, but differ in their range. Similar results are obtained when the AR5 parametric fit is applied to the ISMIP6 models, which is used to estimate rates of change and post-2100 projections. The SROCC noted that the study by Aschwanden et al.,( 2019) projects a significantly higher Greenland contribution to sea level than the assessed likely range in the AR5 and the SROCC. Under RCP8.5, Aschwanden et al., found that Greenland could contribute up to 0.33 m to sea level by 2100 relative to 2000 The SROCC noted that the potentially high sea level in this study could be due to the assumption of spatially uniform warming which can overestimate surface melt rates. However, it also reflects the deep uncertainty surrounding atmospheric forcing, surface processes, submarine melt, calving and ice dynamics. Goelzer et al., ascribe 40% of the ISMIP6 multi-model ensemble spread to ice sheet model uncertainty, 40% to climate model uncertainty and 20% to ocean forcing uncertainty. We note that this finding reflects the current challenges associated with the representation of ice-ocean interactions in models, and the uncertainty in basal conditions. However, this finding is consistent with the work of Aschwanden et al., and thus, there is medium confidence that uncertainty in mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet is dominated by uncertainty in climate scenario and surface processes, whereas uncertainty in calving and frontal melt play a minor role. The SROCC stated that surface processes, rather than ice discharged into the ocean, will dominate Greenland"}

This is confirmed by the ISMIP6 projections. The projected mass loss of Greenland is predominantly due to increased surface meltwater and loss in refreezing capacity resulting in decreasing SMB, concurrent with rising temperatures and darkening of the ice sheet surface. Mass changes due to SMB and outlet glacier dynamics are linked as mass loss by one process decreases mass loss by the other. There is medium confidence that the mass loss through ice discharge will decrease in the future, because an increase in mass loss leads, in most areas, to a retreat of the glacier margin onto land above sea level, isolating the ice sheet from marine influence. In summary, it is virtually certain that the Greenland Ice Sheet will continue to lose mass this century under all emissions scenarios and high confidence that total mass loss by 2100 will increase with cumulative emissions. The sea level assessment is based on the emulated ISMIP6 projections allowing a more consistent approach to a wider range of climate and ocean forcings. The Greenland ice sheet is likely to contribute 0.06 m under SSP1-2.6 and 0.13 m under SSP5-8.5 by 2100 relative to 1995-2014. These projections are lower than the study of (or the range of possible sea level changes resulting from structured expert judgement; Section 9.6.3.2), contributing to the deep uncertainty in projected sea level. There is however high confidence that the loss from Greenland will become increasingly dominated by SMB and surface melt, as the ocean-forced dynamic response of glaciers will diminish as marine margins retreat to higher grounds.

The SROCC did not update the AR5 estimates given limited evidence and low agreement from three new studies. Since the SROCC, a new study gives a sea level contribution of 0.11 to 0.20 m in lowand 0.61 to 1.29 m in highemissions scenarios. The low emissions projections by Van Breedam et al., encompass the AR5 assessed contribution, while the high emissions are higher than that from the AR5. The optimal ensemble member of Aschwanden et al., indicates that Greenland could contribute 0.25 m under RCP2.6 and 1.74 m under RCP8.5. Structured expert judgement projects Greenland losses of 0.54 m under 2oC warming and 0.97 m under 5oC warming. These studies therefore agree that the AR5 and SROCC assessments are at the low end of the range of projections. In addition, observations suggest that Greenland Ice Sheet losses are tracking the upper range of AR5 projections. Therefore, we update the likely range for the contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to GMSL by 2300 to 0.11-0.25 m under RCP2.6 and 0.31-1.74 m under RCP8.5. However, given the uncertainty in climatic drivers used to project ice sheet change over the 21st century and the large range in simulations since AR5 extending beyond 2100, we only have low confidence in the contribution to GMSL by 2300 and beyond. The role of the elevation-mass feedback for future projections of Greenland can be assessed from paleo simulations. Ice sheet model simulations of the Laurentide and Eurasian ice sheets invoke at least some contribution to last glacial termination mass loss from SMB reduction, as a consequence of an elevationmass balance feedback. In a model spanning Meltwater Pulse 1A this mechanism increased mass loss by approximately 66% but in Last Interglacial simulations the effect of this feedback is shown to depend on the surface scheme of the climate model employed. Given the agreement between theoretical analyses and paleo-ice sheet model experiments there is high confidence that the elevation-mass balance feedback is most relevant at multi-centennial and millennial timescales, consistent with future-focused studies. The SROCC adopted the AR5 assessment that complete loss of Greenland ice, contributing about 7 m to sea level, over a millennium or more would occur for a sustained GMST between 1oC and 4oC above pre-industrial levels. New studies since the SROCC confirm this assessment. Clark et al., estimate a complete loss to take about 8000 years at 5.5C and about 3000 years at 8.6C. Based on agreement between new and previous studies there is therefore high confidence that the rate at which Greenland ice sheet commitment is realized depends upon the amount of warming. Accounting for more detailed feedbacks between the atmosphere and the ice sheet found a gradual relationship between sustained global mean warming and the corresponding near-"}

Rather than a climatically-controlled tipping point for irreversible loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet, found a threshold of irreversibility linked to ice sheet size, similar to previous work. The results of Gregory et al., show that if the ice sheet loses mass equivalent to about 3-3.5 m of sea-level rise, it would not regrow to its present state, and 2m of the sea-level rise would be irreversible. At which point in time the current ice sheet might reach this critical volume depends on oceanic and atmospheric conditions, ice dynamics, and climate-ice sheet feedbacks, so projections differ in the magnitude and rate of temperature change to cross the threshold for irreversible loss. Projections from a large ensemble indicate that the mass threshold may be reached as early as in 400 years, if warming reaches as high as >10C above present under extended RCP8.5. In summary, there is high confidence in the existence of threshold behaviour of the Greenland Ice Sheet in a warmer climate, however there is low agreement on the nature of the thresholds and the associated tipping points. BOX 9.3: Insights into land ice evolution from model intercomparison projects Projections of ice sheets and glaciers in the AR5 and the SROCC were assessed by collecting single model studies (with the exception of glaciers in SROCC). Community benchmark experiments (ISMIP-HOM; or Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Projects (MISMIP,; MISMIP3d,; MISMIP+) have substantially advanced ice sheet modelling since the AR5. Model Intercomparison Projects now inform projections of both ice sheets and glaciers: the Ice Sheet MIP for CMIP6, the Linear Antarctic Response MIP and GlacierMIP. Regional forcing for land ice intercomparison projects Simulations of ice sheets and glaciers are dependent on forcing provided by atmosphere and ocean models. Despite progress in representing processes, reducing biases and increasing resolution, regional and global models still have difficulties reproducing observed regional air temperature, surface mass balance and ocean changes. Assessment of CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate models, as forcing for land ice models, has been undertaken with the aim of selecting the best available historical forcings and sampling potential regional future climate changes. Despite improvement in simulation of atmospheric forcing, persistent biases remain in CMIP5/6, which reduces the fidelity of historical and future simulations of land ice. ISMIP6 initial state intercomparison projects The ISMIP6 initial state intercomparison projects for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets were designed to understand the uncertainty in sea level projections resulting from the choice of initialization procedures used for projections of sea level. Participating modelling groups were free to decide on the initialization method used to bring ice sheet models to a present-day state with the effect of these choices captured in a control simulation, which measures intrinsic model drift. Compared to the earlier SeaRISE intercomparison project, the modelled present day ice sheets are in closer agreement with observations and the model drift has been reduced. Nonetheless, historical simulations remain challenging for ice sheet models, due to limited ice sheet observations prior to the satellite era and biases in the historical atmospheric and oceanic forcings from climate models.ISMIP6 and LARMIP-2 therefore did not provide a protocol for the historical runs used to bring the ice sheets to present-day, nor criteria for sub-selecting models from the multi-model ensemble based on ability to reproduce historical changes."}

The participanting ice sheet models are listed in Annex II. For each ice sheet, forcing was selected from the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Atmospheric forcing fields consisted of anomalies in surface mass balance and surface air temperatures generated directly from the CMIP models for the Antarctic ice sheet and downscaled using the MAR regional climate model for the Greenland ice sheet. To sample the uncertainty due to ocean forcings, models used either a model-specific scheme using the ISMIP6-provided oceanic dataset or a standard ISMIP6 approach. For the Greenland ice sheet, the oceanic dataset consists of thermal forcing extrapolated into fjords and subglacial runoff. The standard approach uses timelines of tidewater glacier retreat. For the Antarctic ice sheet, the oceanic dataset consists of salinity, thermal forcing and temperature added to an observationally derived climatology and extrapolated under ice shelves. The standard approach is a basal melt rate that depends quadratically on thermal forcing, adapted from Favier et al.,, with two different calibrations that reproduce observed basal melt rates across Antarctica or Pine Island Glacier, respectively. Antarctic ice shelf disintegration datasets assume that ice shelves disintegrate when annual surface melt reaches a threshold. The ISMIP6 projections are reported as experiment minus control and represent the sea level resulting from future climate change only. The control simulation, which has constant climate conditions starting in 2015 from the historical run, captures drift associated with the choices made for the initialization method and historical run. Subtraction of this control removes any long-term dynamic response of the ice sheet to pre-2015 climate change. This response has been assessed using dynamic discharge derived from observations over the last 40 years, under an assumption that it persists at the past rate until 2100 rather than diminishing. The dynamic response to historical forcing is estimated as 0.19  0.10 mm yr-1 for the Greenland ice sheet and 0.33  0.16 mm yr-1 for the Antarctic ice sheet. Over the period 2015-2100, this leads to an additional sea level contribution of 1.7 cm for Greenland and 2.8 cm for Antarctica. LARMIP-2 projections for the Antarctic ice sheet LARMIP-2 is focused on the uncertainty in the ocean forcing and associated ice shelf melting with the majority of the models also participating in ISMIP6. The experiments start from present day and impose an additional basal ice shelf melting of 8 m yr-1 at the beginning of the 100 yr simulation. A control run is used to remove drift resulting from initialization. The time derivative of the ice sheet response yields a linear response function, which is then convoluted with a forcing of basal shelf melt time series for five Antarctic regions. The forcing time series for RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 were obtained from a random combination of global mean temperature for each RCP from MAGICC-6.0, a scaling factor and time delay for the relationship between global surface air temperature and subsurface ocean warming in a given sector of the Southern Ocean from one of 19 CMIP5 models and a basal melting sensitivity from the interval m yr-1 oC-1 to convert the regional subsurface warming into basal ice shelf melting. This process is repeated 20,000 times to obtain a probability distribution of the sea level contribution for five Antarctic sectors. The linear response framework captures complex temporal responses of the ice sheets resulting from an increase in basal ice shelf melting, but neglects the response to surface mass balance and any self-dampening or self-amplifying processes, such as MISI. The LARMIP-2 method is applied to temperature projections for the SSPs and an estimate of surface mass balance change from the AR5 parametric Antarctic ice sheet surface mass balance model is added to the results. It is not necessary to add a long-term dynamic response to the LARMIP-2 projections, as this is incorporated in the basal melt time series.

Initial conditions were based on version 6 of the Randolph Glacier Inventory and initial ice thickness and volume were provided from an update of Huss and Farinotti,. Forcings were taken from ten different CMIP5 GCMs, selected based on availability of multiple RCPs, the choice in a previous model intercomparison, and performance in glacier-covered regions according to Walsh et al.,. In addition, two global glacier models performed the same experiment with thirteen CMIP6 models. Use of an emulator with ISMIP6 and GlacierMIP projections The ISMIP6 and GlacierMIP projections are primarily based on a limited number of CMIP5 RCPs and CMIP6 SSPs, and a limited sampling of ice-ocean interaction parameters and ice shelf collapse simulations. Emulators provide a method for expanding these projections to a range of SSPs with more comprehensive sampling of climate, ice sheet and glacier modelling uncertainties. Sections 9.4.1.3, 9.4.2.5 and 9.5.1.3 show estimates from the emulator of. This is a Gaussian Process model derived from the ISMIP6 and GlacierMIP simulations; projections use distributions of GSAT from the two-layer emulator and ice sheet parameters as inputs, and include estimates of the emulator uncertainty. Probability intervals are therefore not inflated by a further factor, as is often the case for multi-model ensemble projections, to account for missing uncertainties. The emulator is used in Section 9.6.3 to provide projections of the land-ice contribution to sea level that are fully consistent with each other, ocean heat content, and the assessed equilibrium climate sensitivity and projections of GSAT across the entire report. 9.4.2 Antarctic Ice Sheet 9.4.2.1 Recent observed changes As stated in Section 2.3.2.4, satellite observations by IMBIE combining multi-team estimates based on altimetry, gravity anomalies and the input-output method, already presented in the SROCC, is updated and extended to 2020. The Antarctic ice sheet lost 2670 Gt mass over the period 19922020, equivalent to 7.4 mm global mean sea level rise. Within uncertainties, this estimate agrees with a review of post-AR5 studies up to 2016 and is consistent with recent single studies based on satellite laser altimetry, the input-output method and gravimetry. The mass-loss rate was on average 49 Gt yr-1 over the period 19921999, 70 Gt yr-1 over the period 20002009 and 148 Gt yr-1 over the period 20102016. However, recent work suggests that the mass loss has not further increased since 2016 because of regional mass gains in Dronning Maud Land. Mass loss of the West Antarctic and Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheets has increased since about 2000, essentially due to increased ice discharge The SROCC reported with very high confidence that the acceleration, retreat and thinning of the principal West Antarctic outlet glaciers has dominated the observed Antarctic mass loss over the last decades, and stated with high confidence that these losses were driven by melting of ice shelves by warm ocean waters. The average West Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss of 82  9 Gt yr-1 between 1992 and 2017 leads to substantial observed surface lowering, particularly in coastal regions. Recent studies using satellite altimetry and the input-output method consistently show mass loss in these coastal regions since the late 1970s. Because of consistent multiple lines of evidence, there is high confidence in mass loss of the Totten Glacier in East Antarctica (Miles et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016b;"}

It is currently unclear whether mass loss of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet over the last three decades has been significant or, at 5  46 Gt yr-1 between 1992 and 2017, essentially zero within uncertainties. In summary, WAIS losses, through acceleration, retreat and thinning of the principal outlet glaciers, dominated the AIS mass losses over the last decades and there is high confidence that this is the case since the late 1970s. Furthermore, parts of the EAIS have lost mass in the last two decades. As stated in the SROCC, snowfall and glacier flow are the largest components determining AIS mass changes, with glacier flow acceleration on the WAIS and the Antarctic Peninsula driving total loss trends in recent decades, and a partial offset of the dominating dynamicthinning losses by increased snowfall. The SROCC attributed medium confidence to estimates of 20th-century snowfall increases equivalent to a sea level change of -7.7  4.0 mm on the EAIS and -2.8  1.7 mm on the WAIS, respectively. Loss of buttressing, which can be caused by ice shelf thinning, gradual ice shelf front retreat or ice shelf disintegration, has been linked to instantaneous ice velocity increases and thus dynamic thinning since the early 1990s. This link is clearly evident in the Amundsen and, to a lesser degree, Bellingshausen sectors, where passive shelf ice is very limited or absent. Surface mass balance changes, dominated by snowfall, exhibit strong regional and temporal variability, for example with multidecadal increases in the Antarctic Peninsula inferred since the 1930s, and dominate the interannual to decadal variability of the AIS mass balance. However, no significant continent-wide SMB trend is inferred since 1979. In summary, there is very high confidence that the observed AIS mass loss since the early 1990s is primarily linked to ice shelf changes.

Strong surface meltwater production has been noted as a precursor of ice shelf disintegration in and since the SROCC, and recent work placed strong meltwater production events and seasons in this context. Antarctic ice shelf basal meltwater flux varied between about 1100150 Gt yr-1 in the mid-1990s and about 1570140 Gt yr-1 in the late 2000s before decreasing to 1160  150 Gt yr1 in 2018, and basal melt rates strongly vary with geographical position and depth, as a function of the surrounding water temperature. Section 9.2.2.3 assesses that the intrusion of warm Circumpolar Deep Water, which has warmed and shoaled since the 1980s, has been at least partially controlled by forcing with significant decadal variability. Limited evidence suggests that beyond strong internal decadal wind variability, increased greenhouse gas forcing has slightly modified the mean local winds between 1920 and 2018, facilitating intrusion of Circumpolar Deep Water heat on the Amundsen-Bellingshausen continental shelf and increased ice-shelf melt. However, theoretical understanding is still incomplete and in situ measurements within the ice-ocean boundary layer are sparse. Moreover, modelling and therefore attribution of ice-shelf basal melt remains challenging because of insufficient process understanding, required spatial resolution, the paucity of in-situ observations, and uncertainties of bathymetric datasets under ice shelf cavities. In summary, ice shelf thinning, mainly driven by basal melt, is widespread around the Antarctic coast and particularly strong around the WAIS, although basal melt rates show substantial spatio-temporal variability. Satellite observations suggest that changes in sea ice coverage and thickness can modulate iceberg calving, ice-shelf flow and glacier terminus position around Antarctica, either through mechanical coupling or via changes to ocean stratification, influencing basal melting. A combined observational and modelling study showed that regional loss of a protective sea-ice buffer played a role in the rapid disintegration events of the Larsen A and B and Wilkins ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula between 1995 and 2009, by exposing damaged outer ice-shelf margins to enhanced flexure by storm-generated ocean swells. One observational study suggests that the absence of sea ice in front of ice shelves, which leads to strengthened topographic waves, favours ice shelf basal melt rates by increasing the baroclinic ocean heat flux which can enter the cavity. Paleo evidence for sea ice control on ice sheets is lacking, but geologic evidence shows a concordance between periods of ice sheet growth and the expansion of sea ice, both being favoured by reduced sea surface temperatures. Modelling confirms that sea ice controls the strength of ice melange and thus influences ice shelf flexure and calving rates and stability of floating ice margins, but one model shows this had negligible effect on AIS retreat rates during past warm periods. Loss of ice shelf-proximal sea ice is also associated with increased solar heating of surface waters and increased sub-shelf melting. In summary, although in some cases sea-ice decrease and glacier and ice shelf flow and terminus position changes can have the same common cause, there is medium confidence that sea ice decrease ultimately favours the mass loss of nearby ice shelves through a variety of processes. The SROCC stated with high confidence that ice shelf disintegration has driven dynamic thinning in the northern Antarctic Peninsula over recent decades and expressed high confidence in currently ongoing mass loss from glaciers that fed now disintegrated ice shelves, although the mass loss rate has decreased in the 20 years since the immediate speed-up following ice shelf disintegration in 1995 and 2002. Observed flow speed of these tributary glaciers is still 26% higher than before the ice-shelf disintegration. Conversely, flow speed increase of the tributary glaciers of the Scar Inlet Ice Shelf has been interpreted as a sign of evolving instability of the currently intact ice shelf in one study. Ongoing grounding line retreat, indicating dynamic thinning, is observed with high confidence in many areas of Antarctica and particularly on the WAIS, with the highest rates being in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea areas, and around Totten Glacier in East Antarctica, as stated in the SROCC.

Furthermore observed grounding line retreat in excess of 1.5 km between 2003 and 2015 has been reported for parts of Marie Byrd Land. In summary, there is high confidence that grounding lines of marine-terminating glaciers are currently retreating in many areas around Antarctica, and particularly around the WAIS, and additional areas of grounding line retreat have been evidenced since the SROCC. The SROCC stated with medium confidence that sustained mass losses of several major glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment are compatible with the onset of Marine Ice Sheet Instability, but that whether unstable WAIS retreat had begun or was imminent remained a critical uncertainty. New publications since the SROCC have not substantially clarified this question. On the one hand, a study combining satellite measurements with a numerical model with prescribed ice shelf thinning suggests that MISI is not required to explain the observed current mass loss rates of the WAIS, because they are consistent with external climate drivers. Furthermore, the fast grounding-line retreat of the Pine Island Glacier in the ASE, which was triggered in the 1940s, observed after 1992 and previously interpreted as a sign of MISI, seems to have stabilized recently, and its current flow patterns do not suggest ongoing or imminent MISI. On the other hand, sustained fast grounding line retreat has been observed for Smith Glacier in the ASE, and an analysis of flow patterns and grounding line retreat of the ASE Thwaites Glacier between 1992 and 2017 showed sustained, albeit spatially heterogeneous, grounding line retreat, highlighting ice-ocean interactions that lead to increased basal melt. In addition, Denman Glacier in East Antarctica was shown to hold potential for unstable retreat. In summary, the observed evolution of the ASE glaciers is compatible with, but not unequivocally indicating an ongoing MISI. The SROCC reported limited evidence and medium agreement for anthropogenic forcing of the observed AIS mass balance changes. As stated in Section 3.4.3.2, there remains low confidence in attributing the causes of the observed mass of loss from the Antarctic ice sheet since 1993 in spite of some additional process-based evidence to support attribution to anthropogenic forcing. 9.4.2.2 Model evaluation The AR5 stated that regional climate models and global models with bias-corrected SST and sea ice concentration tended to produce more accurate simulations of Antarctic surface mass balance than coupled climate models, and also noted strong climate model temperature biases over the Antarctic, though the latter may reflect known biases in the reanalysis used. Section Atlas.11.1 assesses that there is medium confidence in the capacity of climate models to simulate Antarctic climatology and surface mass balance changes. Section 9.2.3.2 assesses that there is low confidence in simulations of Southern Ocean temperature. Few ocean models resolve ice shelf cavities, and biases in present-day melt rates can be substantial in some sectors, including the key region of the Amundsen Sea. An increasing number of observational studies from which basal melt rates are calculated, combined with improved understanding of water-mass-specific influences and modes of melting or dissolving, may help to refine these models in the future. However, given the limited number of available models and their biases, there is currently low confidence in the sub-shelf melt rates simulated by ocean models. Improvements in the representation of grounding line evolution in ice sheet models since the AR5 means that most of the model simulations presented in the SROCC were dominated by physical processes. Since then, these advances have been applied in several model intercomparison projects (MISMIP+: Cornford et al.,;"}

All models participating in ISMIP6 and LARMIP-2, for example, simulate ice shelf and grounding line evolution, and include subshelf melt parameterisation, which was not the case in the SeaRISE intercomparison. Simulations of grounding line evolution have benefited from improved bedrock topography. Treatment of subshelf melting, however, remains one of the causes of large differences in Antarctic ice sheet models, particularly for partially floating grid cells in models with coarse resolution. Due to the limitations in resolving cavities in ocean models, as described above, basal melt rates are generally parameterized at the ice-shelf base, based on ocean model simulations of temperatures and salinity instead. While this has the advantage of connecting melt rates to emission scenarios, a large variety of melt parameterisations exist, and there is low agreement due to limited observational constraints(Jourdain et al., 2020), uncertainty in the physics of parameterized processes, missing processes, and uncertainty in the treatment of ice-sheetclimate feedbacks. Parameterisations are usually calibrated to present-day melt rates, but can respond differently to projected ocean warming. Two different calibrations were used in ISMIP6: one reproducing melt rates averaged around the whole continent, and the other reproducing melt rates near the grounding line of Pine Island Glacier, leading to large differences in melt rates. Evaluation with observations and two cavity-resolving models suggests that the MeanAnt parameterisation better reproduces observed melt rates and projected increases in both the warm Amundsen Sea Embayment and cold Ronne-Filchner shelf cavity, as well as total Antarctic melting. The PIGL calibration represents the upper end for increased basal melt sensitivity that would be caused by continent-wide changes to ocean water properties and circulation under strong future forcing. The basal sliding law also has a strong influence on grounding line retreat and glacier acceleration in response to perturbations, and varies spatially. Sliding laws can only be constrained with observations in regions experiencing significant change and with sufficiently long observational records."}

However, while the largescale characteristics of the initial ice sheet state have improved significantly, capturing the smallerscale rates of change, including mass trends, remains challenging for many models. This increases uncertainty in projections, especially for the 21st century. Uncertainties in ice sheet model simulations have been, however, much better quantified since the AR5, through model intercomparison projects, perturbed parameter ensembles, and increasing use of statistical emulation to better sample the parameter space. By exploring uncertainties more fully, these methods have the potential to identify better simulations of the historical period. An important difficulty is how to evaluate simulations of processes that are not currently observed, or rare, or indirectly deduced: in particular, the ice shelf disintegrations and cliff failures that would drive the proposed Marine Ice Cliff Instability(DeConto and Pollard, 2016; DeConto et al., 2021). Models of ice cliff failure can only be indirectly and partially evaluated, using existing cliffs and laboratory experiments. The SROCC stated that there was low agreement on the exact MICI mechanism and limited evidence of its occurrence in the present or the past, and that the validity of MICI remains unproven. Only one ice sheet model represents MICI. The mechanism has not been found to be essential for reproducing Mid Pliocene Warm Period and Last Interglacial reconstructions or satellite observations, though Last Interglacial data slightly favours it in this model. In summary, there is now medium confidence in many ice sheet processes in ice sheet models, including grounding line evolution. However, there remains low confidence in the ocean forcing affecting the basal melt rates and low confidence in simulating mechanisms that have the potential to cause widespread, sustained and very rapid ice loss from Antarctica through MICI. 9.4.2.3 Drivers of future Antarctic ice sheet change Surface mass balance The AR5 projected a negative contribution from Antarctic surface mass balance changes to sea level over the 21st century, due to increased snowfall associated with warmer air temperatures. Sensitivity of SMB to Antarctic surface air temperature change varied from 3.7 to 7 % oC-1, and the sea level projections assumed a sensitivity of 5.1  1.5 % oC-1 from CMIP3 era models to estimate SMB changes from Antarctic temperatures in the CMIP5 ensemble. Since the AR5, analyses of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models have found Antarctic temperature sensitivity for accumulation of 3.5 to 8.7 % oC-1, for SMB of 6.0 to 9.9 % oC-1 and for precipitation of around 4 to 9% oC-1. An accumulation sensitivity estimate derived from ice core data lies in the middle of the range ~6% oC-1. These are consistent, within uncertainties, with each other and the AR5, under the approximation that SMB is dominated by snowfall. The AR5 found that the median and likely sea level contributions due to SMB from 1986-2005 to 2100 were -0.05 under RCP8.5 and -0.02 m under RCP2.6. The SROCC did not present a separate SMB contribution, instead showing total Antarctic projections derived from ice sheet models. Projections of the SMB contribution to sea level tend to be slightly more negative since the AR5, due at least in part to the higher range in equilibrium climate sensitivity values in CMIP6. Mean and  1 s.d. ranges for grounded Antarctic ice sheet SMB changes from 2000 to 2100 computed from CMIP5 models are -0.08 m SLE for RCP8.5 and similarly for CMIP6 models are -0.07 m for SSP5-8.5. The GCMs used to drive ice sheet models in ISMIP6 project mean grounded AIS SMB changes from 2005 to 2100 of -0.06 m SLE under RCP8.5 for the six CMIP5 models and -0.09 m SLE under SSP5-8.5 for the four CMIP6 models, which have climate sensitivity values of 4.8-5.3 oC (Payne et al.,"}

Projections of ice shelf disintegration are uncertain in terms of both atmospheric warming and the response of the shelf surface (surface melting, and whether shelves then disintegrate due to hydrofracturing and flexing, or are resilient through refreezing or drainage;. The SROCC stated it is not expected that widespread ice shelf loss will occur before the end of the 21st century, but this was based on only one study, using a regional climate model forced by five GCMs, so there was low confidence in this assessment. The study of DeConto and Pollard projected the appearance of extensive surface meltwater several decades earlier than and was therefore assessed to be too uncertain to include in the SROCC projections of the Antarctic ice sheet. Since the SROCC, further studies have highlighted the modelling uncertainties in this area. Coastal surface air temperature projections in CMIP6 models show large inter-model differences driven by sea ice retreat, and exhibit more warming relative to global mean temperature under low emissions than high, due to delayed response of the Southern Ocean to stabilised emissions and stratospheric ozone recovery. The updated study of DeConto et al., includes improvements to the climate simulations relative to those in DeConto and Pollard, and the resulting surface meltwater projections are now consistent with Trusel et al.,. However, the net effect of meltwater feedbacks on ice shelves is uncertain. Ice discharge is expected to lead to surface ocean and atmosphere cooling: this increases ocean stratification and sub-shelf melting, but also reduces ice shelf surface melting and delays hydrofracturing. The new studies are insufficient to change the SROCC low confidence assessment on ice shelf loss. The consequence of this uncertainty on projections is discussed in Section 9.4.2.5 and Box 9.4. 9.4.2.4 Ice sheet instabilities A major uncertainty in future Antarctic mass losses is the possibility of rapid and/or irreversible ice losses through instability of marine parts of the ice sheet, proposed via the mechanisms of Marine Ice Sheet Instability and Marine Ice Cliff Instability, and whether these processes will lead to a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet. MISI is a proposed self-reinforcing mechanism within marine ice sheets that lie on a bed that slopes down towards the interior of the ice sheet, whereby, in the absence of ice shelf buttressing, the position of the grounding line is inherently unstable until reaching an upward sloping bed. The SROCC noted advances in modelling MISI since the AR5, but that 'significant discrepancies' remained in projections due to poor understanding of mechanisms and lack of observational data to constrain the models. Since the SROCC, modelling uncertainties have been more thoroughly explored, rather than constrained.. Internal climate variability might either slow or amplify MISI, and stable grounding line positions can be reached on downward sloping beds if ice shelves provide buttressing. Ice sheet model simulations that remove all Antarctic ice shelves show 2-10 m SLE Antarctic mass loss after 500 years due to MISI, of which WAIS collapse contributes 25 m, with the majority of the mass loss in the first one to two centuries. Much of the multi-model variation is due to the sliding law. However, it is not expected that widespread ice shelf loss will occur before the end of the 21st century. A recent update of bed topography that has unveiled large and overdeepened subglacial troughs in East Antarctica potentially vulnerable to MISI has only been used by a few models, so current projections could underestimate vulnerability in these regions. The sea level rise contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet therefore crucially depends on the behaviour of individual ice shelves and outlet glacier systems and whether they enter MISI for a given level of warming. As for Antarctic simulations generally, there is medium confidence in simulating MISI but low confidence in projecting the subshelf melting and ice shelf disintegration that drive it.

Recent support for past MISI is provided by model simulations of the WAIS during the LIG, the British Ice Sheet during the last termination and the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Younger Dryas, which show progressive retreat despite declining temperatures, indicative of a true instability. Direct observational evidence of rapid paleo-ice sheet grounding-line retreat is rare, but on the Larsen continental shelf retreat rates of >10 km yr-1 during the deglaciation have been estimated. MISI has also been inferred from sedimentological evidence of ice loss from Wilkes Subglacial Basin, East Antarctica but these reconstructions cannot unambiguously identify unstable from progressive retreat. Therefore there is limited evidence to identify the operation of instability mechanisms such as MISI in paleo-ice sheet retreat. The SROCC assessed that ice-sheet interactions with the solid Earth are not expected to substantially slow sea-level rise from marine-based ice in Antarctica over the 21st century, but that these processes could become important on multi-century and longer time scales. More recent modelling of deglaciation of the Ross Embayment by is consistent with this assessment. However, new projections for Pine Island Glacier support previous work suggesting lower mantle viscosity in this region leads to a negative feedback on decadal time scales. Grounding-line stabilisation by the solid Earth response may therefore occur over the 21st century in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, where most mass loss is occurring, but more generally occurs over multi-centennial to millennial timescales. The MICI hypothesis describes rapid, unmitigated calving triggered by ice shelf collapse. The SROCC noted that the MICI mechanism led one model to lose mass far more rapidly, but excluded the mechanism from its projections due to uncertainty in the timing of the ice shelf disintegration. They stated that MICI could lead to sea level contributions beyond 2100 considerably higher than the likely range projected by other models, but given the low agreement on the exact MICI mechanism and limited evidence of its occurrence in the present or the past, its potential to affect future sea level rise was very uncertain. Since the SROCC, new simulations show later ice shelf disintegration, in agreement with other models, and therefore lower projections at 2100. New theoretical evidence suggests that ice cliff collapse may only occur after very rapid ice shelf disintegration caused by unusually high meltwater production, and that the subsequent rate of retreat depends on the terminus geometry. As SROCC noted, only Crane Glacier on the Peninsula has shown retreat consistent with MICI, after the Larsen B ice shelf collapsed, and MICI-style behaviour at Jakobshavn and Helheim glaciers in Greenland might not be representative of wider Antarctic glaciers. Observations from Greenland show that steep cliffs commonly evolve into short floating extensions, rather than collapsing catastrophically. As assessed in Section 9.4.2.2 and 9.4.2.3, there is therefore low confidence in simulating mechanisms that have the potential to cause widespread, sustained and very rapid ice loss from Antarctica this century through MICI, and low confidence in projecting the driver of ice shelf disintegration. In summary, poorly understood processes of instabilities, characterized by deep uncertainty, have the potential to strongly increase Antarctic mass loss under high greenhouse gas emissions on century to multicentury timescales. These instabilities are therefore considered separately in assessments of the future contribution to GMSL. 9.4.2.5 Projections to 2100 The AR5 assessed the median and likely sea level contributions of the Antarctic ice sheet in 2100 relative to 1986-2005 to be 0.06 m SLE under RCP2.6 and 0.04 m SLE under RCP8.5. The AR5 stated that only the collapse of the marine-based sectors of the AIS, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century, with medium confidence this would not exceed"}

The assessment of the dynamical contribution had no dependence on emissions scenario, due to the lack of literature, so the decrease in sea level contribution in the higher emissions scenario was solely due to increased SMB. The SROCC assessed the total contribution based on five new ice sheet modelling studies that incorporated marine ice sheet dynamics, combining their estimates and interpreting the 5-95th percentile range of the resulting distribution as the likely range. The median and likely range contributions by 2100 were 0.04 m under RCP2.6 and 0.12 m under RCP8.5. The positive scenario-dependence in the SROCC where increases in dynamic losses driven by ocean warming and ice shelf disintegration under higher emissions dominate over increases in surface mass balance arose from a combination of physical processes and model limitations. Modelling improvements in these studies included improved representations of grounding line response to drivers, more extensive exploration of uncertainties, and inclusion of a positive feedback of meltwater on climate. However, two of the projections did not include surface mass balance changes that would offset dynamic losses, and the scenario dependence may have been further amplified by highly sensitive subshelf melt parameterisations and use of simplified surface mass balance schemes. Since the SROCC, new projections have arisen from multi-model intercomparison projects ISMIP6 and LARMIP-2, with one model including MICI(Table 9.3). Corrections are added to allow comparison: all ISMIP6-derived projections have an estimate of the historical dynamical response to pre-2015 climate forcing added, which increases contributions; the LARMIP-2 dynamic projections are combined with an estimate of surface mass balance, which decreases contributions; and the ISMIP6 emulated and LARMIP-2 projections were reestimated using the global surface air temperature distributions from the two-layer energy budget emulator described in Supplementary Material 7.SM.2. The majority of the new projections indicate that the AIS will overall lose mass and contribute to sea level rise, under all emissions scenarios. Most thinning occurs in the Amundsen Sea sector in WAIS and Totten Glacier in EAIS. The most negative contribution is -0.02 m and the largest contribution is 0.57 m SLE (95th percentile;), or 0.63 m SLE with MICI (95th percentile;). ISMIP6 ensemble ranges are wider for the high scenarios than the low, in part because more simulations were available. The ISMIP6 simulations that apply an ice shelf collapse scenario based on exceedance of a surface meltwater threshold driven by CMIP5 models show only a small increase in mass loss, mostly from the Peninsula, due in part to the small number of ice shelves predicted to collapse this century. Simulations driven by the CMIP5 model HadGEM2-ES, which has unusually extreme warming in the Ross Sea, show a larger mass loss in East Antarctica under ice shelf collapse. The ISMIP6 projections do not include the efficient meltwater drainage or atmospheric feedbacks that could reduce mass loss further. The relationship between emissions scenario and AIS response varies across the studies, with emulated ISMIP6 projections showing a slight negative scenario-dependence in the median from SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5, and LARMIP-2-based projections showing a slight positive scenario-dependence in the median. A lack of clear scenario-dependence in the median masks large individual variations across climate and ice sheet models, whereby the net AIS contribution response to emissions scenario depends on the relative magnitudes of the atmosphere, ocean and ice sheet responses. Climate and ice sheet models do not project that the AIS response will be the same under high or low greenhouse gas emissions in 2100, but rather there is no consensus on the sign of the change. In contrast, strong scenario dependence is seen from RCP4.5 to RCP8.5 in projections that allow MICI (Section 9.4.2.4;(DeConto et al., 2021), though less so than earlier projections due to later ice shelf disintegrations. A negative or positive scenariodependence of the AIS response this century cannot be deduced from recent observations, because there is still low confidence in attributing the causes of observed mass loss, and neither regional mass increases by surface mass balance nor regional mass losses by ice flow have a linear relationship with global mean temperature. There is therefore low agreement on the"}

However, in the longer-term, mass loss is expected to dominate. The LARMIP-2 median projections are higher than those of the ISMIP6 emulator, and the 95th percentiles are two to three times higher. Two possible reasons for the differences between the emulated ISMIP6 and LARMIP-2 projections are assessed: the set of ice sheet models and the parameter values determining subshelf melt sensitivity to ocean temperature. Using only the thirteen ice sheet models common to ISMIP6 and LARMIP-2 reduces the LARMIP-2 median projections by 0.02-0.03 m SLE and the 95th percentiles by 0.04-0.08m SLE, approximately halving the difference in medians but having relatively small effect on the upper end. Subshelf melt sensitivity has a larger effect, due to the wide variation of estimates from different regions and methods. Using only the Pine Island Glacier subshelf melt distribution in the ISMIP6 emulator gives a median Antarctic projection of ~0.08 m in 2100 in all scenarios before historical correction, compared with ~0 m using only the mean Antarctic distribution; the published projections use a joint distribution. Reese et al., find that using the basal melt sensitivities of LARMIP-2 yield an order of magnitude greater mass loss under RCP8.5 than with the ISMIP6 mean Antarctic values. Halving the basal melt sensitivity parameter range would lead to a halving of the LARMIP-2 dynamic contribution. This would reconcile the LARMIP-2 and ISMIP6 emulator median and 95th percentile projections using the common subset of models within ~0.02-0.05 m. There is therefore limited evidence that the ISMIP6 and LARMIP-2 projections could be reconciled by using common ice sheet models and basal melt sensitivity values. It is not possible to distinguish which of ISMIP6 and LARMIP-2 is more realistic due to limitations in historical simulations and understanding of basal melting, so the projections are combined using a 'p-box' approach. The mean of the ISMIP6 emulated and LARMIP-2 medians gives the assessed median projections, and the outer edges of the 17-83% ranges give the outer edges of the assessed likely ranges, i.e., encompassing the structural and parametric uncertainties of both methods, giving medium confidence in their combined projections. The main difference between this assessment and the SROCC is to increase the medians of the lower scenarios by 0.05-0.07 m, so that all SSPs are similar to the SROCC assessment of RCP8.5, and to substantially increase the upper ends of the likely ranges: by 0.14-0.16 m for RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6 and RCP4.5/SSP2-4.5, and 0.06 m for RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5. The increase relative to the SROCC is partly due to the increase in LARMIP-2 projections relative to the original LARMIP study, arising from the larger number of participating ice sheet models. The historical dynamic response to pre-2015 climate forcing applied to the ISMIP6 emulator could be overestimated, due to the assumption of a constant future rate. This assessment encompasses the SROCC and all projections since, except the 83rd percentiles of projections that allow MICI under RCP8.5 and the structured expert judgement under 5C shown in the SROCC. Both are used in further p-box estimates to give the outer limits of low confidence assessments. In summary, it is likely that the Antarctic ice sheet will continue to lose mass throughout this century under all emissions scenarios, i.e., that dynamic losses driven by ocean warming and ice shelf disintegration will likely continue to outpace increasing snowfall. The upper end of projections is not well constrained, due to different assumptions about the future sensitivity of subshelf basal melting to ocean warming and the proposed Marine Ice Cliff Instability triggered by ice shelf disintegration.

New projections agree with previous studies that only part of WAIS would be lost on multi-century timescales if warming remains less than 2C. There is limited agreement about whether complete disintegration would eventually occur at this level of warming, but medium confidence this would take millennia. Under ~23C peak warming, complete or near-complete loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet is projected in most studies after multiple millennia, with continent-wide mass losses of ~25 m SLE or more; this could occur on multi-century timescales under very high basal melting or widespread ice shelf loss and/or MICI. Mass losses under ~23C warming could be less than 2 m SLE, particularly for multi-century timescales, low basal melting, or less responsive sliding laws. If warming exceeds ~3C above pre-industrial, part of the East Antarctic ice sheet is projected to be lost on multi-millennial timescales, with total AIS mass loss equivalent to around 612 m or more sea level rise; mass loss could be much smaller if the dynamic response is small, or much faster under widespread ice shelf loss and/or MICI. A new study by Garbe et al., suggests that 6C sustained warming and associated mass loss of ~12 m SLE may be a critical threshold beyond which the ice sheet re-organises to a new state, leading to large losses from East Antarctica and leading to a further 10 m sea level contribution per degree of warming; other studies also show much higher mass loss per C at higher levels of warming. The SROCC assessed that Antarctic mass losses could be irreversible over decades to millennia. Garbe et al., show that the Antarctic ice sheet is always volumetrically smaller when regrowing under a given warming level than when it retreats under the same forcing, and that even if retreat followed by regrowth results in a net zero change in volume, the spatial distribution of mass may be altered, especially in parts of West Antarctica vulnerable to MISI. Projections that start reducing CO2 concentrations from 2030 onwards, reaching pre-industrial levels around 2300, show sea level contributions exceeding 1 m by 2500 when including MICI. New research therefore confirms the SROCC assessment that mass loss from the AIS is irreversible on decadal to millennial timescales, and suggests that reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations or temperatures to pre-industrial levels may not be sufficient to prevent or reverse substantial Antarctic mass losses. 9.5 Glaciers, permafrost and seasonal snow cover 9.5.1 Glaciers 9.5.1.1 Observed and reconstructed glacier extent and mass changes Global glacier contribution The AR5 assessed glacier changes from studies based on the regions defined in the Randolph Glacier Inventory: a satellite observation-based, global inventory of glacier outlines for the year 2000. Following the SROCC, we report studies based on RGI version 6.0. Increased volume of satellite observations and the inclusion of detailed regional glacier inventories has resulted in an improved inventory. A new consensus estimate for the ice thickness distribution of all glaciers in RGI 6.0 was obtained from an ensemble of five numerical models (although only one out of five models covered all regions) calibrated and validated with the worldwide Glacier Thickness Database (GlaThiDa 3.0;) where possible. The updated inventory shows decreases in estimated glacier volume in the Arctic, High Mountain Asia and Southern Andes, partially compensated by increases in Antarctica. 15% of the total glacier volume is estimated to be below sea level and would not contribute to sea-level rise if melted.

The SROCC found a globally coherent trend of glacier decline in the last decades despite large annual variability and regional differences. Section 2.3.2.3 assesses the global glacier mass changes for the whole 20th century. The AR6 assessment is based on Marzeion et al.,, using glacier-length reconstructions and a glacier model forced by gridded climate observations, and not considering the estimated mass loss of uncharted glaciers. The time series are assumed independent resulting in larger uncertainty than presented in the SROCC. The rate of global glacier mass loss for the period 1901-1990 is estimated to be very likely 210  90 Gt yr-1, representing 16% of the glacier mass in 1901, in agreement with the SROCC within uncertainty estimates. Since the SROCC, new regional estimates for the Andes, High Mountain Asia, Iceland, the European Alps and Svalbard, two new global and an ad-hoc estimate for the latest glaciological observations have extended the glacier mass change time series up to 2018/2019. A reconciled global estimate for the period 1962 to 2019 has been compiled by Slater et al.,. However, in contrast to Slater et al.,, after 2000 this assessment is based on the first globally complete and consistent estimate of 21st-century glacier mass change from differencing of digital elevation models covering 94.7% of glacier area with glacier mass change for each glacier in the inventory produced with unprecedented accuracy. The estimates from agree within uncertainties with new and previous estimates at global and regional scale. Excluding peripheral glaciers of ice sheets, glacier mass loss rate was very likely 170  80 Gt yr-1 for the period 1971 to 2019, 210  50 Gt yr-1 over the period 1993 to 2019 and 240  40 Gt yr-1 over the period 2006-2019. Including the peripheral glaciers of the ice sheets, the global glacier mass loss rate in the period 2000-2019 is very likely 266  16 Gt yr-1 with an increase in the mass loss rate from 240  9 Gt yr-1 in 2000-2009 to 290  10 Gt yr-1 in 2010-2019. These estimates are in agreement with the SROCC estimate and extend the period to 2018/19. In summary, new evidence published since the SROCC shows that during the decade 2010 to 2019 glaciers lost more mass than in any other decade since the beginning of the observational record."}

These results show that during the last 20 years, the highest regional mass loss rates were observed in the Southern Andes, New Zealand, Alaska, Central Europe, and Iceland. Meanwhile, the lowest regional mass loss rates were observed in High Mountain Asia, the Russian Arctic, and the periphery of Antarctica. Glacier mass loss in Alaska, the periphery of Greenland, Arctic Canada North, Arctic Canada South, the periphery of Antarctica, the Southern Andes and High Mountain Asia, represent the majority of the total glacier mass loss during the last 20 years. The glacier mass loss rate from geodetic mass balance assessments in the Southern Andes during 2006-2015 was smaller than previously assessed in the SROCC, though within uncertainties. In the Central and Desert regions of the Southern Andes, an increase in mass loss from 2000-2009 to 2010-2018, and a high loss rate in Patagonia for the whole period, are observed. Records of glacier mass loss in Peru and Bolivia in the period 2000-2016 show an increase in mass loss towards the end of the observation period. In Western North America, outside of Alaska and western Yukon, there was a fourfold increase in mass loss for 2009-2018 compared to 2000-2009, and in the Canadian Arctic there was a doubling of mass loss in the last two decades compared with pre-1996. The peripheral glaciers in NE Greenland experienced a 23% increase in mass loss in 1980-2014 compared to the period 1910-1978/87. In Iceland, 16  4 % of the ~1890 glacier mass has been lost; about half of that loss occurred in the period 1994-2019. Glacier records starting in 1960 in Norway show that half of the observed glaciers advanced in the 1990s but all have retreated since 2000. In Svalbard, glaciers have been losing mass since the 1960s with a tendency towards more negative mass balance since 2000. A similar increase in mass loss has been observed for Franz Josef Land in the Russian Arctic. Rapid retreat and downwasting throughout the European Alps in the early 21st century is reported and long term records, although limited, indicate sustained glacier mass loss in High Mountain Asia since ~1850, with increased mass loss in recent decades. In summary, although interannual variability is high in many regions, glacier mass records throughout the world show with very high confidence that the loss rate has been increasing in the last two decades. Section 2.3.2.3 assesses that the rate and global character of glacier retreat in the latter part of 20th century and finds the first decades of the 21st century appear to be unusual in the context of the Holocene and the global glacier recession in the beginning of the 21st century to be unprecedented in the last 2000 years. These assessments are supported by regional evidence. New reconstructions of the Patagonian Ice Sheet suggest that 20th-century glacial recession occurred faster than at any time during the Holocene. The reconstructions of glacier variations show that the glaciers in some regions are now smaller than previously recorded: since the mid-16th century in the Mont Blanc and Grindelwald regions of the European Alps, since the 9th century in Norway, and for the past 1800 years in NW Iceland. In Arctic Canada and Svalbard, many glaciers are now smaller than they have been in at least 4000 years and more than 40,000 years in Baffin Island. Although the millennial glacier length variation records are incomplete and discontinuous, and glacier fluctuations depend on multiple factors, there is a coherent relationship between rising temperatures, negative mass balance and glacier retreat on centennial timescales across most of the world. Glaciological and geodetic observations show that the rates of early 21st-century mass loss are the highest since 1850. For all regions with long-term observations, glacier mass in the decade 2010 to 2019 was the smallest since at least the beginning of the 20th century.

The SROCC discusses the Karakoram anomaly (centred on the western Kunlun range, but also covering part of the Pamir and Karakoram ranges), where glaciers have been close to balance since at least the 1970s and had a slightly positive mass balance since the 2000s. Since the SROCC, new evidence suggests that this anomaly is related to a combination of low-temperature sensitivity of debriscovered glaciers, a decrease of summer air temperatures, and an increase in snowfall possibly caused by increases in evapotranspiration from irrigated agriculture. However, a recent geodetic mass balance estimate suggests substantially increased thinning rates of High Mountain Asian glaciers after about 2010. There is limited evidence to assess whether the Karakoram Anomaly will persist in coming decades, but due to the projected increase in air temperature throughout the region its longterm persistence is unlikely. Drivers of glacier change The AR5 noted that early-to-mid-Holocene glacier minima could be attributed to high summer insolation, unlike the current situation. Since the AR5, new and improved chronologies of glacier size variations from the end of the last glacial period and the Holocene confirm the dominant role of orbital forcing for millennialscale glacier fluctuations but emphasize the role of other forcings  solar and volcanic activity, ocean circulation, sea ice and internal climate variability  in explaining the regional variability of glacier fluctuations at shorter time scales. Shakun et al., demonstrated that during the last deglacial transition, the mid-to-low-latitude glacier retreat was driven by an increase in atmospheric CO2 and global temperature. In the Northern Hemisphere, where summer insolation decreased during the Holocene, glaciers generally waxed. Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, where summer insolation increased during the Holocene, glaciers generally waned. However, these general global trends were modulated by regional climate variations in temperature and precipitation and there are a number of examples of this. A precipitation increase led to a local early Holocene glacier maximum in arid Mongolia. Glacier advances at ~9 ka in Southwest Greenland have been suggested to be a consequence of the freshwater pulse from the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which led to cooling in the Baffin Bay area. Lake sediments indicate that the glaciers in the region were smaller than today or absent between 8.6 and 1.4 ka BP. Glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula and in Patagonia during the Holocene were strongly affected by the Southern Westerly Winds, sea ice extent, and ocean circulation. Recent studies indicate that explosive volcanism can drive glacier advances. In summary, on millennial time scales over the Holocene, there is high confidence orbital forcing drove hemispheric-scale glacier variations, but new studies provide a nuanced picture of responses to a variety of regional-scale forcings. Section 3.4.3.1 assesses new attribution studies for glaciers and finds that human influence is very likely the main driver of the global, near-universal retreat of glaciers since the 1990s. The SROCC assessed that it is very likely that atmospheric warming is the primary driver for the global glacier recession. Since the SROCC, a study of glaciers in New Zealand used event attribution to confirm a connection between extreme glacier mass loss years and anthropogenic warming. The SROCC stated with high confidence that besides temperature, other factors, such as precipitation changes or internal glacier dynamics, have modified the temperature-induced glacier response in some regions.

Several studies have shown melt increases due to the deposition of lightabsorbing particles. Conversely, increasingly thick debris cover on retreating glaciers can slow down glacier melt. Although debris covers only about 4-7% of the total glacier area globally, many glaciers are heavily debris-covered in their lower reaches, especially in High Mountain Asia, the Caucasus, the European Alps, Southern Andes and Alaska, resulting in different responses to warming than similar clean-ice glaciers. A shift in regional meteorological conditions driven by the location and strength of the upper level zonal wind has been found to have forced recent high mass loss rates in Western North America. High geothermal heat flux areas underneath glaciers and high energy dissipation in the flow of water and ice causes additional mass loss of the glaciers in Iceland, accounting for 20% of the mass loss since 1994. Glacier lake volume, in front of retreating glaciers, has increased globally by around 48% between 1990 and 2018, which can increase both subaqueous melt and calving.

The SROCC relied on six global-scale glacier models based on previously published glacier model projections, and found with high confidence that glaciers will lose substantial mass by the end of the century but assigned medium confidence to the magnitude and timing of the projected glacier mass loss, because of the simplicity of the models, the limited observations in some regions to calibrate them and the diverging initial glacier volumes. Since the SROCC, projected 21st century global-scale glacier mass changes based on seven global-scale and four regional-scale glacier models. All models used the same initial and boundary conditions, forming a more coherent ensemble of projections compared to the SROCC. Nevertheless, challenges remain because of scarcity of glacier thickness, surface mass balance and frontal ablation data for model calibration, but also due to uncertainties in glacier outlines, surface elevations and ice velocities. The global surface mass balance models are of varying complexity, including mass balance sensitivity approaches, temperature-index methods and simplified energy balance calculations.

All models account for glacier retreat and advance but only two models include frontal ablation. Secondary processes such as debris-cover thickening, albedo changes due to light-absorbing particles, trends of refreezing and water storage in firn, dynamic instabilities such as surges or glacier collapse, are not represented in global glacier models, resulting in both underestimated and overestimated sensitivity to warming that is currently not possible to quantify. Furthermore, challenges for future projections are caused by the low resolution and high spatial variability at subgrid scale of the precipitation amount provided by GCMs, which requires downscaling to the spatial scale of a glacier. In summary, in agreement with the SROCC, progress in global scale glacier modelling efforts allows medium confidence in the capabilityof current-generation glacier models to simulate the magnitude and timing of glacier mass changes as a response to the climatic forcing. 9.5.1.3 Projections The AR5 and the SROCC stated with high confidence that the worlds glaciers are presently in imbalance due to the warming of recent decades. The observed retreat of glaciers is only a partial response to the already realized warming, and they are committed to losing considerable mass in the future, even without further change in air temperature. One model estimates that 36  8 % of global glacier mass is already committed to be lost due to past greenhouse gas emissions. Although accumulation and ablation instantly determine the surface mass balance, the glacier geometries adjust to changed atmospheric conditions over a longer time. The adjustment time, often referred to as the response time, is variable from one glacier to another, depending on the glacier geometry, surface mass balance and gradient. Response time is variable: years for smaller and steeper glaciers, up to tens or hundreds of years for larger and gentlesloped glaciers. The models indicate that the disequilibrium between the glaciers and present atmospheric conditions reduces and then disappears at around year 2070. There is therefore very high confidence that the disequilibrium of glaciers will persist as warming continues and that glaciers will continue to lose mass for at least several decades because of their lagged response even if global temperature is stabilized. The SROCC assessed that global glacier mass loss by 2100, relative to 2015 will be 18% for scenario RCP2.6 and 36% for RCP8.5, and that many glaciers will disappear regardless of the emission scenario. Since the SROCC, new results from have been published. Glaciers will lose 29,000 Gt and 58,000 Gt over the period 2015-2100 for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively, which represents 18 % and 36 % of their early 21st century mass, respectively. Within uncertainties, these agree with the SROCC estimates, although with a slightly smaller mass loss due to the inclusion of models with lower sensitivity to changing climate conditions. The greatest source of uncertainty in glacier mass loss until the middle of the 21st century is the disagreement between glacier models, with emissions scenario becoming the dominant cause of uncertainty by the end of the 21st century.

The emulated projections show a narrower range than the roughly equivalent RCP projections, which may be explained by not accounting for covariance in the regional uncertainties and by the fact that the emulator caps sea level contribution for each region at the volume above floatation estimated by.

The global models agree that regions characterized by relatively little glaciercovered area will lose nearly all glacier mass by 2100 in the RCP 8.5 scenario, but their corresponding contribution to sea-level rise will be small. A study using detailed ice dynamics for the largest glacier of the European Alps, Great Aletsch Glacier, projects 60% of present ice volume will be lost by 2100 in RCP2.6 and an almost complete wastage of the ice in RCP8.5. Due to their larger mass, the largest contribution to sea level rise comes from glaciers in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, in spite of having the smallest relative mass loss, and it is expected that they will continue to contribute to sea level rise beyond 2100. The regions with intermediate glacier mass show decreasing mass loss rates for RCP2.6 throughout the 21st century, and increasing rates for RCP8.5 that peak in the mid to late 21st century. The peak in mass loss rate followed by reduction is due to both decreasing glacier volume and stabilizing mass balance. Vatnajokull, the largest glacierin Iceland, is projected to lose about 50% of its mass by 2300 in extended RCP4.5 and 80-100% in extended RCP8.5 scenarios. In summary, both global and regional studies agree that glacier mass loss will continue in all regions, with larger mass loss for high emission scenarios. In the AR5 and the SROCC, glacier mass loss beyond 2100 was calculated employing a parametric fit to available model simulations. In section 9.6.3.5, that same parametric fit is applied to projections resulting in complete glacier mass loss at year 2300 under SSP5-8.5 and 40-100% mass loss under SSP1-2.6. simulate glacier mass evolution, not including glaciers peripheral to the Antarctic ice sheet, for different warming levels for the next ten thousand years. There is limited evidence and low confidence that at sustained warming levels between 1.5 and 2C, about 50-60% of glacier mass will remain, predominantly in the polar regions. At sustained warming levels between 2 and 3C, about 50-60% of glacier mass outside Antarctica will be lost and at sustained warming levels between 3 and 5 C, 60-75% of glacier mass outside Antarctica will disappear. Based on, there is medium confidence that nearly all glacier mass in low latitudes, Central Europe, the Caucasus, Western Canada and the US, North Asia, Scandinavia and New Zealand will disappear at this high warming level. 9.5.2 Permafrost This section focuses on the physical aspects of permafrost as an element of the climate system, drawing on the assessment of observed global permafrost changes provided in Section 2.3.2.5, and treating more specifically model evaluation and projections. The permafrost carbon feedback is assessed in Box 5.1. Section 12.4 of this report provides permafrost information relevant to impacts and risk on regional scales. 9.5.2.1 Observed and reconstructed changes The current extent of the global permafrost region is about 22  3  106 km2.

It is also found in high-altitude areas of mountain ranges in both hemispheres (estimated in the SROCC as representing about 27-29% of the global permafrost area and most unglacierized areas in Antarctica). Ground ice volume in permafrost is variable, reaching up to 90% in syngenetic permafrost deposits. The SROCC reported medium confidence in the estimation that Earths total perennial ground ice volume is equivalent to 2-10 cm of global sea level. There is no evidence suggesting that a large part of this volume, if melted, would run off and contribute to global sea level. Therefore, and because of the modest total volume of mobilizable water, the contribution of permafrost thaw to past and future sea-level budgets is usually neglected. Permafrost changes mostly refer to changes in extent, temperature and active layer thickness. The SROCC reported with very high confidence that record high permafrost temperatures at the depth of the zero annual amplitude were attained in recent decades in the Northern circumpolar permafrost region, high confidence that permafrost has warmed over recent decades in many mountain ranges, and overall very high confidence that global warming over the last decades has led to widespread permafrost warming. As reported in the SROCC, the global permafrost temperature has increased at 0.29  0.12C near the depth of zero annual amplitude between 2007 and 2016. Stronger warming has been observed in the continuous permafrost zone compared to the discontinuous zone, consistent with the fact that near the melting point, a large amount of energy is required for melting the ice, and because of the reduced effect of Arctic amplification in more southerly locations. This is consistent with longer-term Arctic trends from deep boreholes shown in Figure 2.22. Mountain permafrost temperature trends are heterogeneous, reflecting variations in local conditions such as topography, surface type, soil texture and snow cover, but again, generally weaker warming rates are observed in warmer permafrost at temperatures close to 0C, particularly when ice content is high. In summary, strong variability in recent permafrost temperature trends is linked to local conditions, regionally varying temperature trends and the thermal state of permafrost itself, but as discussed in Section 2.3.2.5, there is overall high confidence in the observed increases in permafrost temperature over the past 3 to 4 decades throughout the permafrost regions. Closer to the surface, the active layer undergoes annual cycles of freeze and thaw. The SROCC reported medium confidence in active layer thickness increase as a pan-Arctic phenomenon. Recent evidence presented in Section 2.3.2.5 shows pervasive ALT increase in the European and Russian Arctic in the 21st century and in high elevation areas in Europe and Asia since the mid-1990s. Emergence of a clearer global picture is hampered by uneven distribution of observing sites, substantial variability among the existing sites, strongly influenced by local conditions; interannual variability , and thaw settlement in ice-rich terrain. In summary, in agreement with the SROCC and recent evidence presented in Section 2.3.2.5, there is medium confidence that ALT increase is a pan-Arctic phenomenon. There is medium confidence that the observed acceleration and destabilization of rock glaciers is related to warming temperatures and increase in water content at the permafrost table in recent decades. There is also medium confidence that observed increases in size and frequency of rock avalanches are linked to permafrost degradation in rock walls. In summary, there is medium confidence that mountain permafrost degradation at high altitude has increased the instability of mountain slopes in the past decade. The SROCC assessed with high confidence that the extent of subsea permafrost, formed before submersion on Arctic continental shelves during the last deglaciation, is much reduced compared to older studies that had estimated the entire formerly exposed Arctic shelf area to be underlain by permafrost. This is supported by observations that show rapid thaw of recently submerged permafrost on the East Siberian Shelf . A modelling study estimates that 97% of permafrost under Arctic"}

Based on multiple studies, there is medium confidence that widespread retreat of coastal permafrost is accelerating in the Arctic. There is also consistent evidence of complete permafrost thaw in areas of discontinuous and sporadic permafrost since about 1980, but this evidence is geographically scattered. In spite of increasing evidence of landscape changes from site studies and remote sensing, quantifying permafrost extent change remains challenging because it is a subsurface phenomenon that cannot be observed directly. A modelling study for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau between the 1960s and the 2000s suggests transition from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground over an area of more than 400,000 km2. In summary, there is medium confidence that complete permafrost thaw in recent decades is a common phenomenon in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost regions. In addition, paleoclimatic evidence presented in Section 2.3.2.5 confirms a long-term sensitivity of permafrost extent to climatic variations, although an analysis of North American speleothem records over the last two glacial cycles indicates that this apparent high sensitivity could be a consequence of regional-scale variability. There is a lack of formal studies attributing observed permafrost changes or associated landscape changes to anthropogenic forcing. However, the observed Arctic warming has been attributed to anthropogenic forcing and an obvious physical link exists between ground temperatures and surface air temperatures. Therefore physically consistent and convergent lines of evidence lead to medium confidence in anthropogenic forcing being the dominant cause of the observed pan-Arctic permafrost changes. Added to this, local permafrost change by soil and ecosystem disturbance is induced by increasing human industrial activities in the Arctic. 9.5.2.2 Evaluation of permafrost in climate models As stated in AR5, coupled models contributing to CMIP5 showed large inter-model variability of permafrost extent due to deficiencies in reproducing surface characteristics and processes, particularly thermal properties of the ground and snow. These deficiencies led the SROCC to express only medium confidence in the models capacity to correctly project the magnitude of future permafrost changes, in spite of high confidence in the models projection of a general thaw depth increase and a substantial loss of shallow permafrost. The SROCC further noted that several types of physical pulse disturbances, in particular fire and thermokarst formation, are usually not represented in coupled climate models. This has been discussed in detail in the SROCC, which assessed that there is high confidence that permafrost degradation through fire is currently occurring faster in some well-studied regions than during the first half of the 20th century, and medium confidence that thermokarst formation, to which about 20% of the northern permafrost region is vulnerable, can lead to faster large-scale permafrost degradation in response to climate change. Since the SROCC, dedicated modelling of the evolution of iceand organic-rich permafrost in the northeast Siberian lowlands has shown that not representing thermokarst-inducing processes in ice-rich terrain leads to a systematic underestimation of the rapidity and magnitude of permafrost thaw. Simplified inventory-based modelling points towards similar conclusions. Although these pulse disturbances still need to be represented in CMIP-type models, there have been many new developments to that type of model since CMIP5 and the AR5. Soil freezing and its thermal and hydrological effects are now included in a large number of land-surface modules that are part of the CMIP6 ensemble, sometimes allowing for the effects of excess ice. Improved representation of snow insulation in models has led to more realistic simulated permafrost extents. In a post-CMIP5 ensemble of land-surface models driven by observed"}

More detailed descriptions of high-latitude vegetation characteristics, vegetation dynamics, and snow-vegetation interactions have been included in several models since the AR5. A total soil column depth of at least about 10 m is required to adequately represent the dampening effect of seasonal-scale heat exchanges between shallow and deeper ground, and thus to correctly simulate active layer thickness. However, many CMIP6 models still have shallower total soil columns and the proportion of models with deeper total soil columns has not increased since CMIP5. Another recently identified process, usually not represented in the current generation of climate models, is warming-driven decomposition and burning of organic material that provides strong thermal insulation of underlying ground. Decay of the insulating organic material can lead to increased permafrost thaw, creating a positive feedback loop. In spite of the aforementioned structural improvements to many models, the simulated current permafrost extent from available CMIP6 models shows no substantial improvement with respect to CMIP5. The extent of the region where permafrost is simulated within the top 15 m in the Northern Hemisphere for the 1979-1998 period is characterized by very large scatter in the coupled CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations compared to estimates of the present permafrost extent based on multiple observational lines of evidence and models based on satellite observations and reanalyses. Outliers with very low simulated permafrost extent are models that have only a very shallow soil column and do not take into account soil water phase changes. These inadequacies lead to an overestimate of seasonal thaw depth, exceeding the total thickness of the models soil columns. Excessive simulated permafrost extent can in several cases be traced to insufficient thermal insulation by the winter snow cover. Figure 9.22a also shows that the corresponding land-atmosphere simulations with prescribed observed seasurface temperatures and sea-ice concentrations, and the land-only simulations with prescribed reanalysisbased meteorological forcing, do not provide an improved simulation of the current permafrost extent, although, by construction, they can be expected to exhibit lower land surface climate biases. This further points to deficiencies in the land modules as the main reason for biases, consistent with conclusions drawn from the analysis of CMIP5 output, as reported in the SROCC and the AR5. In spite of more realistic description of permafrost-related processes in many coupled climate models, the CMIP6 models thus still produce a very scattered ensemble of estimates of current permafrost extent, and there is high confidence that this is strongly linked to deficiencies of the representation of soil processes. Furthermore, current-generation climate models tend to neglect several physical disturbances that can lead to faster permafrost thaw. Because of large uncertainties in the future evolution of these drivers, there is limited evidence that these shortcomings lead to an underestimate of permafrost degradation rates in response to climate change in the CMIP6 ensemble. In summary, there is high confidence that coupled models correctly simulate the sign of future permafrost changes linked to surface climate changes, but only medium confidence in the amplitude and timing of the transient response.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. 9.5.2.3 Projected permafrost changes The AR5 and the SROCC both expressed high confidence that future pan-Arctic thaw depth will increase and near-surface permafrost extent will decrease under future global warming, and medium confidence in the magnitude of the simulated changes because of model deficiencies and large spread of the results. The equilibrium sensitivity of permafrost extent to stabilized global mean warming has been inferred to be about 4.0106 km2 C-1 for GSAT changes with respect to the present below about +3C. This equilibrium permafrost sensitivity, relevant for assessing long-term permafrost changes at a stabilized warming level, is about 20% higher than the transient centennial-scale near-surface permafrost extent sensitivity suggested by direct analysis of CMIP5 output. Compared to these and other studies reported in the AR5 and the SROCC, the recently suggested equilibrium extent sensitivity to GSAT changes of about 1.5106 km2 C-1 based on idealized ground temperature modelling appears unrealistically low. A strong transient temperature sensitivity of the volume of perennially frozen soil in the top 3 m below the surface is consistently suggested by the available CMIP6 models. Relative to the current volume, the transient sensitivity of the modelled permafrost volume in the top 3 m to GSAT changes is about 25  5 % C-1, but there is only medium confidence in this value and 1s.d. uncertainty range because of the model deficiencies discussed in 9.5.2.2. It is important to note that permafrost loss will not be limited to the top 3 m, with delayed response of deeper permafrost. The simulated transient temperature sensitivity of permafrost volume is slightly stronger in the SSP1-2.6 scenario than in other SSPs because subsurface temperature lag increases with higher atmospheric warming rates, particularly when ground ice melting induces additional delays. Due to the role of air temperature as a major driver of permafrost change, the SROCC expressed very high confidence that permafrost in high-mountain regions is expected to undergo increasing thaw and degradation during the 21st century, with stronger consequences expected for higher greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Recently published studies support this SROCC assessment. In summary, based on high agreement across CMIP6 and older model projections, fundamental process understanding, and paleoclimate evidence, it is virtually certain that permafrost extent and volume will shrink as global climate warms. 9.5.3 Seasonal snow cover Mean snow cover extent in January and February, the usual months of maximum extent, covers about 45% of the Northern Hemisphere land surface (more than 45 million km2 over the 1967-2014 period). In contrast, maximum seasonal snow cover in South America, the dominant ice-free land mass in the Southern Hemisphere in terms of seasonal snow cover extent, remains well below 1 million km2 or less than 2% of the Southern Hemisphere land surface."}

The role of snow in the global surface albedo feedback is assessed in Section 7.4.2.3. The effect of aerosol deposition on snow albedo and associated climate forcing is assessed in Section 7.3.4.3. 9.5.3.1 Observed changes of seasonal snow cover The AR5 reported that NH SCE in June very likely decreased by 11.7% per decade over the 1967-2012 period, exceeding the absolute and relative reductions observed in March and April. The AR5 further reported very high confidence that NH March and April SCE decreased over the 90 years after 1922. The SROCC only assessed snow cover changes for the Arctic and mountain areas. For the Arctic, the SROCC expressed high confidence in SCE decreases of -3.5  1.9% per decade in May and -13.4 5.4% per decade in June, based on a combination of multiple datasets. Concerning mountain snow cover, the SROCC reported with high confidence that mountain snow cover has generally declined since the middle of the 20th century at lower elevations. At higher elevations, the SROCC reported medium confidence in generally insignificant snow cover trends where these were available. The large-scale assessment provided in Section 2.3.2.2 of this report reports very high confidence in substantial reductions of NH snow cover extent since 1978, and states that there is limited evidence that this decline extends back to the early 20th century. Since the SROCC, progress in characterizing seasonal NH snow cover changes has been made through the combined analysis of datasets from multiple sources. A recent combined dataset identified negative NH SCE trends in all months between 1981 and 2018, exceeding -50  103 km2yr-1 in November, December, March and May. The loss of spring SCE is also reflected in earlier spring snow melt, derived from surface observations, satellite observations, and model-based analyses. There is considerable inter-dataset and regional variability, but the continental-scale trends of spring snowoff dates from these datasets are consistently negative. Satellite-derived estimates of NH SCE compiled within the NOAA snow chart Climate Data Record extend back to 1967, providing one of the longest environmental data records from spaceborne measurements. Continental trends from these coarse resolution estimates show declining snow cover during the spring period, consistent with surface warming. As assessed in Section 2.3.2.2, there is therefore very high confidence that the NH spring SCE has been decreasing since 1978. Hemispheric reconstructions with simple snow models and in-situ observations have extended the satellite record to 1922, putting the satellite era in historical context. This study, also assessed in the AR5, suggests an increase in North American spring SCE from 1915 to about 1950, followed by a decrease of the same total magnitude afterwards. In Eurasia, a negative trend in April is visible over the entire 1922-2010 period of record, while in March, a step decrease at about 1985 separates two periods with insignificant trends. Overall, combining March and April, consistency between the continental trends since 1950 and agreement in sign with the NOAA satellite record since 1967 provides high confidence in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover decrease since about 1950. Analysis of paleoclimate records suggests that recent snowpack reductions in western North America are exceptional on a millennial timescale."}

However, even state-of-the-art snow models intended for meteorological and climate applications still struggle to correctly represent the time evolution of the snow thermal properties, particularly of cold and dry tundra snow. Moreover, most, if not all, CMIP6 climate models do not explicitly represent the darkening of snow by deposition of BC and other light-absorbing aerosol species that is known to influence snow melt rates. Regardless of these shortcomings, snow modules of climate models continue to be improved. Recent progress includes the incorporation of multiple energy balances within the canopy and between subgrid-tiles with different snow heights and inclusion of advanced specific snow models in coupled climate models, opening the prospect of future progress in quantifying snow-related feedbacks in a changing climate. Recently developed multi-physics snow models, which are able to emulate the behaviour of a large number of models in a broad range of climates, allow model shortcomings and key parameter uncertainties, for example, concerning snow masking by vegetation or snow thermal conductivity, to be identified. Guidance for future model improvement can be provided by improved diagnostics, such as a concise metric of snow insulation, which builds on an observed relation between effective seasonal mean snow depth and the dampening of winter season temperature decrease within the soil, and allows an efficient quantification of inaccuracies in the simulated snow insulation effect. There is high confidence that large inter-model variations in the snow-cover sensitivity to temperature can largely be explained by inaccuracies in the simulated snow albedo feedback; a multimodel sub-ensemble of CMIP5 models that simulate a correct magnitude of this feedback presents a 40% reduced spread in the projected 21st century Northern Hemisphere land warming trend. Errors of the simulated feedback strength were linked to 1) systematic positive albedo biases over the boreal forest belt, mostly due to unrealistic treatment of vegetation masking, 2) inaccurate prescribed tree cover fraction and inappropriate parameterization of leaf area index in some models and 3) low spatial resolution leading to inaccuracies in the strength of the simulated SAF in mountainous regions. Although the representation of snow albedo feedback improved in many CMIP5 models over CMIP3, some models deteriorated. Analysis of the available CMIP6 historical simulations for the 1981-2014 shows that on average, CMIP6 models simulate well the observed SCE, except for outliers and a median low bias during the winter months. This is an improvement over CMIP5, in which many snow-related biases were linked to inadequacies of the vegetation masking of snow cover over the boreal forests. A comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP6 results shows that there is no notable progress in the quality of the representation of the observed 1981-2014 monthly snow cover trends.

Altimeters have the advantage of quasi-global coverage but are limited to a period in which the forced trend response is just emerging on regional scales. An analysis of the local altimetry error budget to estimate 90% confidence intervals on regional sea-level trends and accelerations reports that 98% of the ocean surface has experienced significant sea-level rise over the satellite era. The same study finds that sea-level accelerations display a less uniform pattern, with an east/west dipole in the Pacific, a north/south dipole in the Southern Ocean and in the North Atlantic, and 85% of the ocean surface experiencing significant sea-level acceleration or deceleration, above instrumental and post processing noise. Longer records are available from tide gauges, albeit with variable coverage by basin. Regional departures from GMSL rise are primarily driven by ocean transport divergences that result from wind stress anomalies and spatial variability in atmospheric heat and freshwater fluxes. The SROCC noted the occurrence of large multiannual sea-level variations in the Pacific, associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in particular, and involving the El Nino Southern Oscillation, North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole. There was intensified sea-level rise during the 1990s and 2000s, with 10-year trends exceeding 20 mm yr-1 in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, while sealevel trends were negative on the North American west coast.

During periods of subpolar North Atlantic warming, winds along the European coast are predominantly from the south and may communicate steric anomalies onto the continental shelf, driving regional sea-level rise, with the reverse during periods of cooling. High rates of sealevel rise in the North Indian Ocean are accompanied by a weakening summer South Asian monsoon circulation. The Arctic ocean is typically excluded from global sea-level studies, owing to the uncertainties associated with resolving sea-level in ice-covered regions, strong variations in GRD effects, and uncertain GIA estimates. Spanning 1991-2018, a very likely sea-level riseof 1.16-1.81 mm yr-1 is observed. Since the SROCC, the forced response in regional sea level varies in time with the relative influence of different forcing agents. The SROCC estimated regional sea-level changes from combinations of the various contributions to sealevel change from CMIP5 climate model outputs, allowing comparison with satellite altimeter and tidegauge observations. Closure of the regional sea-level budget is complicated by the fact that regional sea-level variability is larger than GMSL variability and there are more processes that need to be considered, such as vertical land movement and ocean dynamical changes. A number of observation-based studies have focussed on specific areas, such as the Mediterranean, the South China Sea, the US east coast, the North Atlantic basin and the Northwestern European continental shelf seas. Studies using tide gauge data and observation-based estimates of the contributions find that, while local agreement is not yet possible, the observational sea-level budget can be closed on a basin scale. A budget analysis for the GRACE era found that the budget closes in some but not all coastal regions: substantial parts of the sea-level change signal in the North Atlantic could not be explained by steric or barystatic changes. This is in agreement with other work comparing climate model estimates to 20th century tide gauge observations, where the majority of local spatial variability is determined by the ocean dynamic component. Vertical land movement is another major cause of local spatial variability in sea-level change, and for instance relevant for oceanic islands. In summary, the regional sea-level budget, using either observations or models, can currently only be closed on basin scales, with large uncertainties remaining on smaller scales."}

Whereas SROCC assessed with high confidence that GMSL rise is attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, they assessed with medium confidence that the regional anomalies in ocean basins are a combination of the response to anthropogenic GHG emissions and internal variability. The simulated ocean dynamic and thermosteric response to external forcings during 1861-2005 is larger than simulated internal variability only in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific on a 1 grid, but on spatial scales exceeding 2000 km a detectable signal is revealed in the last 45 years in 63% of the global ocean area.

Partly on the basis of these studies the SROCC proposed a plausible upper bound on GMSL of 25 m with evidence suggesting an Antarctic contribution of anywhere between 5.4  17.8 m.

Southern Hemisphere glaciation was characterised by an Antarctic ice sheet reduced in volume from present with mountain ice fields in the Andes of South America. Ice sheet models are inconsistent in the magnitude of the sea level contribution from Antarctica but nearfield sedimentological reconstructions support precessionally-modulated and eccentricity-paced multi-metre sea level contributions from the Wilkes Subglacial Basin over 3  5 kyr. In summary, under a past warming level of around 2.5  4 oC, ice sheets in both hemispheres were reduced in extent compared to present. Proxy-based evidence combined with numerical modelling indicates that, on millennial timescales, the GMSL contribution arising from ice sheets was >5 m or >10 m. Marine Isotope Stage 11 The SROCC noted that Greenland may have been ice-free for extensive periods during Pleistocene interglaciations, implying a high sensitivity of the Greenland ice sheet to warming levels close to present day. The AR5 assigned medium confidence to a MIS 11 GMSL of 619 15 m above present, requiring a loss of much of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, and a possible contribution from East Antarctica. High-resolution multi-proxy sea surface temperature reconstructions and climate model simulations concur that MIS 11 was an extremely long interglacial that exhibited positive annual (0.5  1.6 oC,) and summer (2.13.4 oC,) temperature anomalies. GMSL was 6-13 m above present. The Greenland Ice Sheet lost 4.56 m) or ca. 6.1 m sea-level equivalent by ca. 7 kyr after peak summer warmth, with marine-based ice from AIS contributing 6.48.8 m sea-level equivalent at this time. Agreement between GMSL and ice-sheet reconstructions gives high confidence in identifying a high sensitivity of both ice sheets to the protracted duration of thermal forcing even at low warming levels. Modelled mean mass loss rates for the Greenland Ice Sheet of 0.4 m kyr-1 during MIS 11 are indistinguishable from recent mass loss rates averaged over 19922018. In summary, geological reconstructions and numerical simulations consistently show that past warming levels of <2 oC are sufficient to trigger multi-metre mass loss from both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets if maintained for millennia, in agreement with the SROCC findings for comparable warming levels during MIS 5e, the Last Interglacial. Last Interglacial The AR5 found the LIG GMSL was >5 m but <10 m. Their best estimate of 6 m was based on two studies. The SROCC concluded that during the Last Interglacial the Greenland contribution to the GMSL highstand of 69 m increased gradually whereas the Antarctic contribution occurred early, from ca. 129 ka. Due to widely varying reconstructions from model studies and the paucity of direct evidence of ice sheet change, the magnitude of sea-level contributions from both ice sheets was assigned low confidence. Since the AR5, information about the LIG, when GMST was about 0.5-1.5C above 1850-1900, has improved. The LIG had higher summer insolation than present and polar amplified sea surface and surface air temperatures that reached >14 oC and >311 oC in the Arctic respectively. Mean annual and maximum summer ocean temperatures peaked early in the interglacial period, reaching 1.1  0.3 oC above the modern global mean with summer anomalies of 2.53.5 oC in the Southern Ocean and spatially variable timing.

An abrupt ~1.1 m sea-level rise at ~8.2 ka was associated with drainage of the pro-glacial lakes Agassiz and Ojibway, attributed to accelerated melt from collapsing Laurentide Ice Sheet ice saddles. The Laurentide Ice Sheet provided the greatest contribution to early Holocene GMSL, the Scandinavian ice sheet contributed ~2 m from the beginning of the Holocene until its demise by ~10.5 ka,, whilst the Barents Sea ice sheet contributed a small but unknown amount. The Greenland Ice Sheet contributed ~4 m, consistent with ice thinning rates inferred from the Camp Century ice core. Recent estimates of Antarctic contributions during the early Holocene vary considerably from ~1.2 m to ~8.5 m. In summary, the early Holocene was characterised by steadily rising GMSL as global ice sheets continued to retreat from their LGM extents. This steady rise was punctuated by abrupt pulses during episodes of rapid meltwater discharge. In the middle Holocene, GMST peaked at 0.2-1.0C higher than 1850-1900 temperature between 7 and 6 ka. GMSL rise slowed coincidently with final melting of the Laurentide ice sheet by 6.7  0.4 ka, after which only Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets could have contributed significantly. At 6 ka, GMSL was -3.5 to +0.5 m. Simulations of the Holocene Thermal Maximum give a Greenland ice sheet broadly consistent with geological reconstructions so, despite uncertainties regarding the timing of minimum ice sheet volume and extent, there is medium confidence that minima were reached at different times in different areas during the period 8-3 ka BP. Geochronological and numerical modelling studies indicate that it is likely that the period of smaller-than-present ice extent in all sectors of Greenland persisted for at least 2000 to 3000 years. Based on ice sheet modelling and 14C dating suggested that West Antarctic grounding lines retreated prior to ~10 ka BP, followed by a readvance. Other studies from the same region conclude that retreat was fastest from 9 to 8 ka BP, or from 7.5 to 4.8 ka BP. Marine geological evidence indicates open marine conditions east of Ross Island by 8.6  0.2 ka BP. In the western Weddell Sea, reported rapid glacier thinning from 7.5 to 6 ka BP. concluded that the fastest thinning further south took place from 6.5 to 3.5 ka BP, potentially contributing 1.4-2 m to GMSL. Geophysical data indicate stabilisation or readvance in this area around 6  2 ka BP. In coastal Dronning Maud Land rapid thinning occurred 9 to 5 ka BP, whereas glaciers in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula receded during the period 11 to 8 ka BP and readvanced to their maximal extents by 7 to 4 ka BP. In summary, higher-than-pre-industrial GMST during the mid Holocene coincided with recession of the Greenland Ice Sheet to a smaller-than-present extent. Multiple lines of evidence give high confidence that thinning or retreat in parts of Antarctica during the Holocene took place at different times in different places, but limited data means there is only low confidence in whether or not the ice sheet as a whole was smaller than present during the mid Holocene. In summary, both proxies and model simulations indicate that GMSL changes during the early to mid Holocene were the result of episodic pulses, due to drainage of meltwater lakes, superimposed on a trend of steady rise due to continued ice sheet retreat. The combination of tide gauge observations and geological reconstructions indicates that a sustained increase of GMSL began between 1820 and 1860 and led to a 20th century GMSL rise that was very likely faster than in any preceding century in the last 3000 yr. At a regional level, tide gauge and geological data from the North Atlantic and Australasia show inflections in relative sealevel trends between 1895-1935, with an increase of 0.8 to 2.5 mm yr-1 across the inflection.

In four of the twenty regions, all in the North Atlantic, the 19th century rate was also greater than the 0-1700 CE average.

Process-level assessments in sections 9.2.4, 9.4.1.3, 9.4.1.4, 9.4.2.5, 9.4.2.6 and 9.5.1.3 are synthesised to produce new global-mean and regional sea-level projections based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways up to 2150 and on global warming levels up to 2100. Long-term global mean sea-level projections, both at 2300 and on multimillennial timescales, are also assessed. In sections 9.6.3.3 and 9.6.3.4, likely ranges of the new global-mean sea-level projections are presented, incorporating only processes in whose projections there is at least medium confidence, consistent with headline projections in the AR5 and the SROCC. As emphasized by the SROCC, there is a substantial likelihood that sea level rise will be outside the likely range. As described in Box 1.1, since the definition of likely refers to at least 66% probability, there may be as much as a 34% probability that the processes in which there is at least medium confidence will generate outcomes outside the likely range. Furthermore, additional processes in which there is low confidence may also contribute to sealevel change. The presentation of likely sea-level change is therefore accompanied by a low confidence range intended to reflect potential contributions from additional processes under high-emissions scenarios. The low confidence range incorporates ice-sheet projections based on both structured expert judgement and projections from an Antarctic ice sheet model that includes the Marine Ice Cliff Instability. 9.6.3.1 Global mean sea level projections based on the Representative Concentration Pathways The AR5 generated global mean sea level projections for the Representative Concentration Pathways by combining information from CMIP5 climate models with glacier and ice-sheet surface mass balance models and assessments of projected ice-sheet dynamic and land-water storage contributions. The SROCC updated the AR5 projections based upon a revised assessment of the Antarctic ice sheet contribution to GMSL rise. The AR5 and the SROCC employ a baseline period of 1986 to 2005, which is updated in this report to a baseline period of 1995 to 2014. Between these two periods, GMSL rose by 3 cm and this correction is applied to projections from previous reports to allow comparison. Accounting for this shift, the conclusion of the SROCC is that, with medium confidence, GMSL will rise between 0.40 m and 0.81 m by 2100 relative to 1995-2014. The AR5 and the SROCC projections of GMSL for the 2007-2018 period have been shown to be consistent with observed trends in GMSL and regional weighted mean tide gauges. Since the AR5, , a number of projections of GMSL rise have been published based on the RCPs(see for a database; Tables 9.SM.5, 9.SM.6).

For processes in whose projections we have at least medium confidence, the likely range projections for the Antarctic ice sheet are based upon 1) the emulated ISMIP6 ensemble and 2) the LARMIP-2 ensemble, augmented with the AR5 parametric Antarctic surface mass balance model. GMSL projections are produced with both distributions and combined in a p-box, which represents the upper and lower bounds of the distribution. A likely range is then identified, spanning the lower of the two 17th percentile projections and the higher of the two 83rd percentile projections5, with the median taken as the mean of the medians of the two projections. Since the ISMIP6 emulator does not account for temporal correlation, the AR5 parametric AIS model is substituted for the emulator in the p-box for rates of change. As the AR5 projections are modestly lower than those from the ISMIP6 emulator, this substitution modestly broadens the likely range at the low end for projections of rate and changes beyond 2100. For projections beyond 2100, the AIS simulations are extrapolated using the same two approaches as the GrIS projections. The likely ranges to 2100 are consistent with the SROCC. Low confidence ice sheet projections To test the possible effect of additional ice-sheet processes for which there is low confidence, two additional approaches are considered. For both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, we produce sensitivity cases employing the SEJ projections of, mapping 2C and 5C stabilization scenarios to SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. For the Antarctic ice sheet, we produce an additional sensitivity case using projections, which incorporate the Marine Ice Cliff Instability, mapping projections for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 to SSP12.6 and SSP5-8.5. For the Greenland ice sheet, the SEJ projections indicate the potential for outcomes outside the corresponding likely ranges. For the Antarctic ice sheet, there is no evidence from these studies to suggest an important role under lower emissions scenarios for processes in whose projections we have low confidence. By contrast, for SSP5-8.5, the SEJ and MICI projections exhibit 17th-83rd percentile ranges of 0.02-0.56 m and 0.19-0.53 m by 2100, consistent with one another but considerably broader than the likely contribution for medium confidence processes of 0.03 to 0.34 m. This lower level of agreement for higher emissions scenarios reflects the deep uncertainty in the AIS contribution to GMSL change under higher emissions scenarios. This deep uncertainty grows after 2100: by 2150, under SSP 5-8.5, medium confidence processes likely lead to a -0.1 to 0.7 m AIS contribution, while SEJ and MICI-based projections indicate 0.0-1.1 m and 1.4-3.7 m, respectively. Glaciers In the AR5 and the SROCC, global glacier mass changes were derived from a power law of integrated global-mean surface temperature change fit to results from four different glacier models. The updated projections use emulated GlacierMIP projections. Since the GlacierMIP emulator does not account for temporal correlation and terminates, along with the GlacierMIP simulations, in 2100, we employ a parametric fit to the GlacierMIP simulations, with a functional form similar to that employed by the AR5, to calculate rates of change and extrapolate changes beyond 2100. This approach leads to a median glacier contribution that is a minimal change from the AR5 and the SROCC and a modest narrowing of likely ranges. For RCP 2.6, the AR5 projected 0.10 m, compared to 0.09 m projected here for SSP1-2.6. For RCP 8.5, the AR5 projected a likely contribution of 0.17 m, compared to 0.18 m projected here. Land water storage In the AR5 and the SROCC, the groundwater depletion contribution to GMSL rise was based on combining results from two approaches, one assuming a continuation of early 21st century trends and the other using land-surface hydrology models. Together, these yielded a range of about 0.02-0.09 m of GMSL rise by 2080-2099. The rate of water impoundment in reservoirs was likewise based"}

There is high confidence in the understanding of GRD processes. RSL rise associated with GRD is very likely to be largest in the Pacific, due to the combined effects of projected GrIS, AIS and glacier mass loss. The GRD effect associated with mass loss from an ice sheet is sensitive to the spatial distribution of that mass loss. For example, the GRD contribution to RSL rise in Australia will be larger for Antarctic mass loss sourced fromthe Antarctic Peninsula than for Antarctic mass loss sourced fromThwaites Glacier. In parts of northeastern North America and northwestern Europe, GRD effects associated with mass loss from southern Greenland will lead to a RSL fall, whereas mass loss from northern Greenland will lead to a RSL rise. The AR5 and the SROCC computed RSL patterns using a gravitationally self-consistent GRD solver given the amounts, locations and timing of the projected barystatic sea-level changes driven by glaciers, ice sheets and LWS. A similar GRD solver is used in the updated projections (following). The Earth model used is based on PREM, and is elastic, compressible and radially stratified. Glacial isostatic adjustment and other drivers of vertical land motion Glacial Isostatic Adjustment leads to vertical land motion and changes in sea-surface height, both of which contribute to RSL change. GIA uncertainty is caused by uncertainty in the rheological structure of the solid Earth, which drives the longer-term viscous Earth deformation, as well as in the modelled global ice history. In the AR5 and the SROCC, GIA contributions to relative sea-level change were calculated using a sea-level equation solver with an ice-sheet history taken as the mean of the ICE5G and ANU ice sheet models. Since the AR5, new global models are emerging that more rigorously treat ice and Earth structure uncertainty. However, there is also a growing recognition that lateral variations in Earth structure limit the utilityof global models that treat the solid Earth as though it were laterally uniform. As noted by the SROCC, VLM from sources other than GIA  including tectonics and mantle dynamic topography, volcanism, compaction, and anthropogenic subsidence  can be locally important, producing VLM rates comparable to or greater than rates of GMSL change. Complete global projections of these processes are not available because of the small spatial scales, the sensitivity of subsidence to local human activities, and the stochasticity of tectonics. Integrated RSL projections to date have therefore either included only the component of VLM associated with GIA, as in the AR5 and SROCC, or used a constant long-term background rate of change estimated from historical tide gauge trends (e.g.,). The updated projections use the second approach and extrapolate the field of long-term background rates of RSL change, including long-term VLM derived from tide gauges, to global coverage using a spatiotemporal statistical approach. The combined GIA and long-term VLM is assumed to be constant over the projected period and scenario independent. In areas where rapid subsidence occurs in a cluster of tide-gauges, the associated rates are interpolated between the tide gauges. In areas where the available tide-gauges exhibit large, tectonically driven VLM that changes considerably in rate over short distances a sizable uncertainty propagates into the RSL projections. Rates of RSL rise are likely to be underestimated due to subsidence in shallow strata that are not recorded by tide gauges and in some locations may therefore be minimum values, especially if anomalously high subsidence rates associated with fluid extraction (e.g.,) are also considered. There is therefore, depending on location, low to medium confidence in the GIA and VLM projections employed in this report. In many regions, higher fidelity projections would require more detailed regional analysis."}

Consistent with the AR5, loss of land-ice mass will be an important contributor to spatial patterns in relative sea-level change, with ocean dynamic sea-level being particularly important as a dipolar contributor in the Northwest Atlantic, a positive contributor in the Arctic Ocean, and a negative contributor in the Southern Ocean south of the ACC. As today, vertical land motion will remain a major driver of relative sea-level change. Uncertainty in relative sea-level projections is greatest in tectonically active areas in which vertical land motion varies over short distances and in areas potentially subject to large ocean dynamic sea-level change.

The high uncertainty in projections around Alaska and the Aleutian Islands arises from the tectonic contribution to vertical land motion, which varies greatly over short distances in this region. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. An alternative perspective on uncertainty in future sea-level rise is provided by looking at uncertainty in time rather than elevation; that is, looking at the range of dates when specific thresholds of sea-level rise are projected to be crossed. Considering only medium confidence processes, GMSL rise is likely to exceed 0.5 m between about 2080 and 2170 under SSP1-2.6 and between about 2070 and 2090 under SSP58.5. It is likely to exceed 1.0 m between about 2150 and some point after 2300 under SSP1-2.6, and between about 2100 and 2150 under SSP5-8.5. It is unlikely to exceed 2.0 m until after 2300 under SSP1-2.6, while it is likely to do so between about 2160 and 2300 under SSP5-8.5. However, processes in whose projections there is low confidence could lead to substantially earlier exceedances under higher emissions scenarios: under SSP5-8.5, 1.0 m could be exceeded by about 2080 and 2.0 m could be exceeded by about 2110, with 5th percentile projections as early as about 2070 for 1.0 m and 2090 for 2.0 m.

While conceptual studies provide medium evidence of these processes, substantial uncertainties and low agreement in quantifying their future evolution arise from limited process understanding, limited availability of evaluation data, missing or crude representation in model simulations, their high sensitivity to uncertain boundary conditions and parameters, and/or uncertain atmosphere and ocean forcing. In Antarctica, high warming might lead to floating ice shelves starting to break up earlier than expected due to processes not yet accounted for in ice-sheet models or in current climate models used to force ice-sheet projections. Such processes include hydrofracturing driven by surface meltwater and increase in ocean thermal forcing driven by ocean circulation changes. In particular, the Thwaites and Pine Island Glacier ice shelves could potentially disintegrate this century, which might trigger MICI before 2100. MISI could potentially develop earlier and faster than simulated by the majority of models if fast flowing ice streams follow plastic, instead of currently assumed more viscous, sliding laws. Oceanic feedbacks could drive high-end sea-level rise by changes in the meltwater-driven overturning circulation in ice cavities that cause additional melting; by a warming of the ocean water in contact with the ice shelves due to increased stratification and thus reduced vertical mixing; or by an increase in sea-ice cover due to increased ocean stratification, which could reduce the amount of warm, moist air that reaches the continent and limit the mass gain from snowfall over the ice sheet. In Greenland, stronger mass loss than currently projected might also occur. For example, warming-induced dynamical changes in atmospheric circulation could enhance summer blocking and produce more frequent extreme melt events over Greenland similar to the record mass loss of more than 500 Gt in summer 2019. Cloud processes in polar areas that are not well represented in models could further enhance surface melt, as could feedbacks between surface melt and the increasing albedo from meltwater, detritus and pigmented algae. The same ice dynamical processes associated with basal melt and MISI discussed for Antarctica could also occur in Greenland as long as the ice sheet is in contact with the ocean. The strength of all these processes is currently understood to depend strongly on global mean temperature and polar amplification, with additional linkages through feedback from global mean sea-level. These dependencies on a joint forcing imply that processes are strongly correlated. Hence, both their uncertainties and their possible cascading contribution to high-end sea-level rise are expected to combine. High-end sea-level rise can therefore occur if one or two processes related to ice-sheet collapse in Antarctica result in an additional sea-level rise at the maximum of their plausible ranges or if several of the processes described in this box result in individual contributions to additional sea-level rise at moderate levels. In both cases, global-mean sea-level rise by 2100 would be substantially higher than the assessed likely range, as indicated by the projections including low confidence processes reaching in 2100 as high as 1.6 m at the 83rd percentile and 2.3 m at the 95th percentile. Identifying the potential drivers of a high-end sea-level rise allows identification of sites and observables that can provide early warnings of a much faster sea-level rise than the likely range of this and previous reports. One potential site for such monitoring is Thwaites Glacier, which is melting faster in some places and slower in others than models simulate. At this glacier, the effect of tides and channelling of warm water flows on the melting is evident, making the floating ice shelf potentially vulnerable to breakup from hydrofracturing, driven by surface meltwater, much earlier than expected. In addition, the glacier is retreating towards a zone with deeper bedrock, which at its present rate of retreat would be reached in 30 years. Thwaites Glacier is therefore a strong candidate to experience large-scale MISI and/or MICI, making it the ideal site for monitoring earlywarning signals of accelerated sea-level-rise from Antarctica. Such signals could possibly be observed within"}

The most common observation platform for surface waves over the past 30 years are in-situ buoys. However, evolving biases associated with changing instrument type, configuration and sampling methodology introduce artificial trends. Accurate metadata is required to address these issues, and, while available locally, are only beginning to be globally coordinated. Wave reanalysis and hindcast products have also been used to investigate total water level at global scale. Their applicability for trend analysis is limited by inhomogeneous data for assimilation, but they inform relationships between seasonal, inter-annual to inter-decadal variability of climate indices and wind-wave characteristics. To summarise, satellite era trends in wave heights of order 0.5 cm yr-1 have been reported, most pronounced in the Southern Ocean. However, sensitivity of processing techniques, inadequate spatial distribution of observations, and homogeneity issues in available records limit confidence in reported trends. Only a few studies have attempted to quantify the role of anthropogenic climate change in ESL events. Detection and attribution of the human influence on climatic changes in surges, and waves remains a challenge, with limited evidence to suggest in some instances, changes in surges and waves can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. With relative sea-level change being considered the primary driver of observed tidal changes, there is medium confidence that these changes can be attributed to human influence. The close relationship between local ESL and long-term relative sea level change, combined with the robust attribution of GMSL change, implies that observed global changes in ESL can be attributed, at least in part, to human-caused climate change, but reconciling regional variation in these changes is not yet possible. 9.6.4.2 Future changes There are two distinct methods used to project future ESL changes. The static, or mean sea level offset, approach employs historical distributions of tidal, surge and wave components and adjusts future ESL distributions for mean relative sea level rise. The dynamic approach employs hydrodynamic and/or wave models forced with GCM-derived atmospheric fields to project changes in tidal, storm surge and wave distributions, which are then combined with relative sea level projections to project future ESLs. The dynamic approach is computationally expensive. Use of the dynamic approach on large spatial or global scales has only recently been successful to project 21st Century changes in ETWL and ECWL. assume stationarity in global wave and storm surge simulations to assess projected 21st century changes in episodic coastal ETWL driven flooding under global sea-level rise scenarios. The SROCC presents projections of ESL derived using a static approach. Such projections often quantify changes in ESL event frequency, expressed as frequency amplification factors. Like relative sea level projections, frequency amplification factors increase under higher emission scenarios, and differences between scenarios increase over time. The SROCC concludes that even small to moderate changes in mean relative sea level can lead to hundredto thousand-fold increases in the frequencies with which certain thresholds are exceeded; e.g., what is currently a 1-in-100 year ESL height will be expected once or even multiple times per year in future at many locations. The SROCC showed that currently rare ESL events will occur annually or more frequently at most available locations for RCP4.5 by the end of the century. Results from these assessments are sensitive to the type of ESL probability distribution assumed, as well as the magnitude and uncertainty of projected relative sea level change. Frequency amplification factors tend to be largest in tropical regions due in part to higher relative sea level rise projections, but primarily to the relative rarity of high ESLs in areas"}

How long would it take for them to grow back? Evidence from the distant past shows that some parts of the Earth system might take hundreds to thousands of years to fully adjust to changes in climate. This means that some of the consequences of human-induced climate change will continue for a very long time, even if atmospheric heat-trapping gas levels and global temperatures are stabilized or reduced in the future. This is especially true for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which grow much more slowly than they retreat. If the current melting of these ice sheets continues for long enough it becomes effectively irreversible on human timescales, as does the sea level rise caused by that melting. Humans are changing the climate and there are mechanisms that amplify the warming in the polar regions. The Arctic is already warming faster than anywhere else. This is significant because these colder high latitudes are home to our two remaining ice sheets: in Antarctica and Greenland. Ice sheets are huge reservoirs of frozen freshwater, built up by tens of thousands of years of snowfall. If they were to completely melt, the water released would raise global sea level by about 65 m. Understanding how these ice sheets are affected by warming of nearby ocean and atmosphere is therefore critically important. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are already slowly responding to recent changes in climate, but it takes a long time for these huge masses of ice to adjust to changes in global temperature. That means that the full effects of a warming climate may take hundreds or thousands of years to play out. An important question is whether these changes can eventually be reversed, once levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are stabilized or reduced by humans and natural processes. Records from the past can help us answer this question. For at least the last 800,000 years, the Earth has followed cycles of gradual cooling followed by rapid warming caused by natural processes. During cooling phases, more and more ocean water is gradually deposited as snowfall, causing ice sheets to grow and sea level to slowly decrease. During warming phases, the ice sheets melt more quickly, resulting in more rapid rises in sea level. Ice sheets build up very slowly because growth relies on the steady accumulation of falling snow that eventually compacts into ice. As the climate cools, areas that can accumulate snow expand, reflecting back more sunlight that otherwise would keep the Earth warmer. This means that once started, glacial climates develop rapidly. However, as the climate cools, the amount of moisture that the air can hold tends to decrease. As a result, even though glaciations begin quite quickly, it takes tens of thousands of years for ice sheets to grow to a point where they are in balance with the colder climate. Ice sheets retreat more quickly than they grow because of processes that, once triggered, drive selfreinforcing ice loss. For ice sheets that are mostly resting on bedrock above sea level  like the Greenland ice sheet  the main self-reinforcing loop that affects them is the elevationmass balance feedback. In this situation, the altitude of the ice sheet surface decreases as it melts, exposing the sheet to warmer air. The lowered surface then melts even more, lowering it faster still, until eventually the whole ice sheet disappears. In places where the ice sheet rests instead on bedrock that is below sea level and which also deepens inland, including many parts of the Antarctic ice sheet, an important process called marine icesheet instability is thought to drive rapid retreat. This happens when the part of the ice sheet that is surrounded by sea water melts. That leads to additional thinning, which in turn accelerates the motion of the glaciers that feed into these areas. As the ice sheet flows more quickly into the ocean, more melting takes place, leading to more thinning and even faster flow that brings ever-more glacier ice into the ocean, ultimately driving rapid deglaciation of whole ice-sheet drainage basins. These self-reinforcing processes explain why relatively small increases in temperature in the past led to very substantial sea level rise over centuries to millennia, compared to the many tens of thousands of years it takes to grow the ice sheets that lowered the sea level in the first place. These insights from the past imply that if human-induced changes to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets continue for the rest of this century, it will take thousands of years to reverse that melting, even if global air temperatures decrease"}

As of 2018, global average sea level was about 1525 cm higher than in 1900 and 715 cm higher than in 1971. Sea level will continue to rise by an additional 1025 cm by 2050. The major reasons for this ongoing rise in sea level are the thermal expansion of seawater as its temperature increases and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. Local sea level changes can be larger or smaller than the global average, with the smallest changes in formerly glaciated areas and the largest changes in low-lying river delta regions. Across the globe, sea level is rising, and the rate of increase has accelerated. Sea level increased by about 4 mm per year from 2006 to 2018, which was more than double the average rate over the 20th century. Rise during the early 1900s was due to natural factors, such as glaciers catching up to warming that occurred in the Northern Hemisphere during the 1800s. However, since at least 1970, human activities have been the dominant cause of global average sea level rise, and they will continue to be for centuries into the future. Sea level rises either through warming of ocean waters or the addition of water from melting ice and bodies of water on land. Expansion due to warming caused about 50% of the rise observed from 1971 to 2018. Melting glaciers contributed about 22% over the same period. Melting of the two large ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica has contributed about 13% and 7%, respectively, during 1971-2018, but melting has accelerated in the recent decades, increasing their contribution to 22% and 14% since 2016. Another source is changes in land water storage: reservoirs and aquifers on land have reduced, which contributed about a 8% increase in sea level. By 2050, sea level is expected to rise an additional 1025 cm whether or not greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. Beyond 2050, the amount by which sea level will rise is more uncertain. The accumulated total emissions of greenhouse gases over the upcoming decades will play a big role beyond 2050, especially in determining where sea level rise and ice sheet changes eventually level off. Even if net zero emissions are reached, sea level rise will continue because the deep ocean will continue to warm and ice sheets will take time to catch up to the warming caused by past and present emissions: ocean and ice sheets are slow to respond to environmental changes. Some projections under low emissions show sea level rise continuing as net zero is approached at a rate comparable to today, while others show substantial acceleration to more than five times the present rate by 2100, especially if emissions continue to be high and processes that accelerate retreat of the Antarctic Ice Sheet occur widely. Sea level rise will increase the frequency and severity of extreme sea level events at coasts,, such as storm surges, wave inundation and tidal floods: risk can be increased by even small changes in global average sea level. Scientists project that in some regions, extreme sea level events that were recently expected once in 100 years will occur annually at 20-25% of locations by 2050 regardless of emissions, but by 2100 emissions choice will matter: annually at 60% of locations for low emissions, and at 80% of locations under strong emissions. In many places, local sea level change will be larger or smaller than the global average. From year to year and place to place, changes in ocean circulation and wind can lead to local sea level change. In regions where large ice sheets, such as the Fennoscandian in Eurasia and the Laurentide and Cordilleran in North America, covered the land during the last ice age, the land is still slowly rising up now that the extra weight of the ice sheets is gone. This local recovery is compensating for global sea level rise in these regions and can even lead to local decrease in sea level. In regions just beyond where the former ice sheets reached and the Earth bulged upwards, the land is now falling, and as a result local sea level rise is faster than the global rate. In many regions within low-lying delta regions, the land is rapidly subsiding because of human activities such as building dams or groundwater and fossil fuel extraction. Further, when an ice sheet melts it has less gravitational pull on the ocean water nearby. This reduction in gravitational attraction causes sea level to fall close to the ice sheet while causing sea level to rise farther away. Melt from a polar ice sheet therefore raises sea level most in the opposite hemisphere or in low latitudes  amounting to tens of centimetres difference in"}

Regional reanalyses represent the distributions of precipitation, surface air temperature, and surface wind, including the frequency of extremes, better than global reanalyses. However, their usefulness is limited by their short length, the typical regional model errors, and the relatively simple data assimilation algorithms. Global and regional climate models are important sources of climate information at the regional scale. Global models by themselves provide a useful line of evidence for the construction of regional climate information through the attribution or projection of forced changes or the quantification of the role of the internal variability. Dynamical downscaling using regional climate models adds value in representing many regional weather and climate phenomena, especially over regions of complex orography or with heterogeneous surface characteristics. Increasing climate model resolution improves some aspects of model performance. Some local-scale phenomena such as landsea breezes and mountain wind systems can only be realistically represented by simulations at a resolution of the order of 10 km or finer. Simulations at kilometre-scale resolution add value in particular to the representation of convection, sub-daily precipitation extremes and soilmoisture precipitation feedbacks. Sensitivity experiments aid the understanding of regional processes and can provide additional user-relevant information.. The performance of global and regional climate models and their fitness for future projections depend on their representation of relevant processes, forcings and drivers and on the specific context. Improving global model performance for regional scales is fundamental for increasing their usefulness as regional information sources. It is also key for improving the boundary conditions for dynamical downscaling and the input for statistical approaches, in particular when regional climate change is strongly influenced by large-scale circulation changes. Increasing resolution per se does not solve all performance limitations. Including the relevant forcings and representing the relevant feedbacks in global and regional models is a prerequisite for reproducing historical regional trends and ensuring fitness for future projections. The sign of projected regional changes of variables such as precipitation and wind speed is in some cases only simulated in a trustworthy manner if relevant regional processes are represented.. Statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators are useful approaches for improving the representation of regional climate from dynamical climate models. Statistical downscaling methods with carefully chosen predictors and an appropriate model structure for a given application realistically represent many statistical aspects of present-day daily temperature and precipitation. Bias adjustment has proven beneficial as an interface between climate model projections and impact modelling in many different contexts. Weather generators realistically simulate many statistical characteristics of present-day daily temperature and precipitation, such as extreme temperatures and wetand dry-day transition probabilities. The performance of statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators in climate change applications depends on the specific model and on the dynamical climate model driving it. Knowledge is still limited about suitable predictors for statistical downscaling of regional climate change, particularly for precipitation. Bias adjustment cannot overcome all consequences of unresolved or strongly misrepresented physical processes, such as large-scale circulation biases or local feedbacks, and may instead introduce other biases and implausible climate change signals. Using bias adjustment as a method for statistical downscaling, particularly for coarse-resolution global models, may lead to substantial misrepresentations of regional climate and climate change. Instead, dynamical downscaling may resolve relevant local processes prior to bias adjustment, thereby improving the representation of regional changes. The performance of statistical approaches and their fitness for future projections depends on predictors and change factors taken from the driving dynamical models."}

Multi-model ensembles enable the assessment of regional climate response uncertainty. Discarding models that fundamentally misrepresent processes relevant for a given purpose improves the fitness of multi-model ensembles for generating regional climate information. At the regional scale, multi-model mean and ensemble spread are not sufficient to characterize low-probability, high-impact changes or situations where different models simulate substantially different or even opposing changes. In such cases, storylines aid the interpretation of projection uncertainties. Since AR5, the availability of multiple single-model initial-condition large ensembles allows for a more robust separation of model uncertainty and internal variability in regional-scale projections and provides a more comprehensive spectrum of possible changes associated with internal variability. Interplay between Human Influence and Internal Variability at Regional Scales Human influence has been a major driver of regional mean temperature change since 1950 in many sub-continental regions of the world. Regional-scale detection and attribution studies as well as observed emergence analysis provide robust evidence supporting the dominant contribution of human influence to regional temperature changes over multidecadal periods. While human influence has contributed to multi-decadal mean precipitation changes in several regions, internal variability can delay emergence of the anthropogenic signal in long-term precipitation changes in many land regions. Multiple attribution approaches, including optimal fingerprinting, grid-point detection, pattern recognition and dynamical adjustment methods, as well as multi-model, single-forcing large ensembles and multi-centennial paleoclimate records, support the contribution of human influence to several regional multi-decadal mean precipitation changes. At regional scale, internal variability is stronger and uncertainties in observations, models and human influence are all larger than at the global scale, precluding a robust assessment of the relative contributions of greenhouse gases, stratospheric ozone, different aerosol species and land use/land cover changes. Multiple lines of evidence, combining multi-model ensemble global projections with those coming from SMILEs, show that internal variability is largely contributing to the delayed or absent emergence of the anthropogenic signal in long-term regional mean precipitation changes. Various mechanisms operating at different time scales can modify the amplitude of the regional-scale response of temperature, and both the amplitude and sign of the response of precipitation, to human influence. These mechanisms include non-linear temperature, precipitation and soil moisture feedbacks, slow and fast responses of sea surface temperature patterns and atmospheric circulation changes to increasing greenhouse gases. Urban Climate Many types of urban parameterizations simulate radiation and energy exchanges in a realistic way. For urban climate studies focusing on the interplay between the urban heat island and regional climate change, a simple single-layer parameterization is fit for purpose. New networks of monitoring stations in urban areas provide key information to enhance the understanding of urban microclimates and improve urban parameterizations. The difference in observed warming trends between cities and their surroundings can partly be attributed to urbanization. Annual-mean daily minimum temperature is more affected by urbanization than annual-mean daily maximum temperature. The global annual-mean surface air temperature response to urbanization is, however, negligible."}

This concept is embodied in the subseasonal-to-seasonal and the seasonal-to-multiannual prediction activities that generate regional climate information across temporal scales. The seamless framework benefits from the convergence of methods traditionally used in weather forecasting and climate projections, in particular the role of the initialization in climate models and the strategies for the evaluation of physical processes relevant at different temporal scales. The relatively short observational record is a primary challenge to estimate the forced signal and to isolate low-frequency, multi-decadal and longer term internal variability. Because only one realization of the actual climate exists, it is nontrivial to extract estimates of internal and forced variability from the available data. As an alternative, approaches that use large observational ensembles can be applied. There is a close relationship between spatial and temporal scales. For example, an individual convective storm may exhibit scales of variability ranging from metres and seconds to kilometres and hours, while for El Nino-Southern Oscillation the scales of variability are regional to hemispheric in extent and multi-year in length. These scales interact and the interactions are represented in climate models, although the ability of current models to simulate regional phenomena and even large-scale climate drivers still leaves room for improvement and limits their capability to represent the interactions across spatial and temporal scales. It is important to note that in this chapter and subsequent regional chapters, including the Interactive Atlas, the baselines and reference periods used for climate change estimates from regional models may vary from those used in Chapters 19. In these chapters three main time baselines are defined for the past, i.e., preindustrial, early-industrial and recent, while the future reference periods are 20212040, 20412060 and 20812100. Regional climate simulations used in the recent literature have been performed with different baselines. The differences are often due to the availability of the boundary conditions from global simulations, leading to periods chosen for those simulations like 19502005, in line with the CMIP5 historical simulations followed by projections from 2005 onwards. For simulations that use CMIP3 boundary conditions other periods have been used. As a consequence, these regional simulations mix for the recent period historical simulations with projections. The mismatch needs to be considered when assessing results obtained from both global and regional models in the context of the climate information distillation process, or when linking the regional chapters to the assessments performed in previous chapters. The choice of baseline provides a source of uncertainty for the assessment of climate impacts. Besides, a range of different baselines may need to be considered to satisfy a variety of users, since this choice affects the perceived result. The influence of the different baseline periods can be explored using the Interactive Atlas where different baselines are available, for example, 1986-2005, 1995-2014, and both 1961-1990 and 1981-2010. One way of overcoming the baseline uncertainty is to define the results for a given model based on specific global-mean temperature changes from the pre-industrial period. The specific global-mean temperature is known as global warming level. The GWL is a useful dimension of integration because important changes in regional climate, including many types of extremes, scale quasi-linearly with the GWLs, often independently of the underlying emissions scenarios, taking always into account caveats described in Cross-Chapter Box 11.1. In addition, GWLs allow a separated analysis of the global and regional climate responses associated with a warming level. The choice of global temperature goal in the"}

The degree of confidence in climate simulations and in the resulting climate information typically depends on the identification of the role of the uncertainties. Since the direct verification of simulations of future climate changes is not possible, model performance and reliable uncertainty estimates need to be assessed indirectly through process understanding and a systematic comparison with observations of past and current climate. The observational uncertainty, which is particularly large at regional scales, also has to be taken into account. These uncertainty estimates are then propagated in the distillation process to generate climate information. Uncertainties in model-based future regional climate information arise from different sources and are introduced at various stages in the process: 1) forcing uncertainties associated with the future scenario or pathway that is assumed, 2) internal variability, and 3) uncertainties related to imperfections in climate models, also referred to as structural or model uncertainty. However, the relative role of each of these sources of uncertainty differs between the global and the regional scales as well as between variables and also between different regions. One way to address the internal variability and model uncertainties is to consider results from both multiple models and multiple realizations of the same model. These models are at times also combined with different weights that are a function of their performance and independence to increase the confidence of the multi-model ensemble. Other elements that play a role are the inconsistency between the global and regional models in dynamical downscaling or the observational and methodological uncertainty in bias-adjustment methods. These elements, in addition to those typical of the uncertainty in global and large-scale phenomena, affect the overall confidence of regional climate information. This complex scene with different sources of uncertainty makes the collection of results available from multi-model, multi-member simulations most useful when synthesized through a distillation process. 10.1.4 Distillation of Regional Climate Information Regional climate information is synthesized from different lines of evidence from a number of sources taking into account the context of a user vulnerable to climate variability and change at regional scales and the values of all relevant actors in a process called distillation. Distillation, understood as the process of synthesizing information about climate change from different lines of evidence obtained from a variety of sources and taking into account the user context and the values of all relevant actors, allows the connection of global climate change to the local and regional scales, where adaptation responses and policy decisions take place. Climate information is translated into the user context in a co-production process that introduces further user-relevant elements leading to user-relevant climate information for a specific demand like, for instance, guiding climate-resilient development. The approaches adopted in the distillation of regional climate information are diverse and range from the simple delivery of data as information to co-production with the user using as many lines of evidence as possible. The availability and selection of the sources and the approach followed has implications for the usefulness of the information. For instance, it is well established that it is invalid to take a time series from a grid cell of a model simulation as equivalent to an observational estimate of a point within the cell, due to the lack of representativeness, and consequently the information building solely on this type of data source is of limited use. Relevant decisions are made during the distillation process such as what method is most suitable to a specific user context and the question being addressed. The information may be provided in the form of summarised raw data, a set of user-oriented"}

This information frames the treatment of the production of regional climate information in previous reports and identifies some of the gaps that AR6 needs to address. AR5 In the WGI Chapter 9, regional downscaling methods were addressed as tools to provide climate information at the scales needed for many climate impact studies. The assessment found high confidence that downscaling adds value both in regions with highly variable topography and for various small-scale phenomena. Regional models necessarily inherit biases from the global models used to provide boundary conditions. Furthermore, the ability of AR5 to systematically evaluate RCMs, and statistical downscaling schemes, were hampered because coordinated inter-comparison studies were still emerging. However, several studies demonstrated that added value arises from higher resolution in regions where stationary small-scale features like topography and complex coastlines are present, and from improved representation of small-scale processes like convective precipitation. WGI Chapter 14 stressed that credibility in regional climate change projections increases when key drivers of the change are known to be well-simulated and well-projected by climate models. The Working Group II Chapter 21 addressed the regional climate change context from the perspective of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation. This chapter emphasized that a good understanding of decision-making contexts is essential to define the type and scale of information required from physical climate. Further, the chapter identified that the regional climate information was limited by the paucity of comprehensive observations and their analysis along with the different levels of confidence in projections. Notably, at the time of the AR5, many studies still relied on global datasets, models, and assessment methods to inform regional decisions, which were not considered as effective as tailored regional approaches. The regional scale was not defined but instead it was emphasised that climate change responses play out on a range of scales, and the relevance and limitations of information differ strongly from global to local scales, and from one region to another. Chapter 21 noted that the production of downscaled datasets remains weakly coordinated, and that results indicate that high-resolution downscaled reconstructions of the current climate can have significant errors. Key in this was that the increase in downscaled data sets has not narrowed the uncertainty range, and that integrating these data with historical change and process-based understanding remains an important challenge. The chapter identified the common perception that higher resolution equates to more usable and robust information, which is not necessarily true. Instead, it is through the integration of multiple sources of information that robust understanding of change is developed. WGII Chapter 21 highlighted that the different contexts of an impact study are defining features for how climate risk is perceived. Perspectives were characterized as top-down and bottomup perspectives. The top-down perspective uses climate change impacts as the starting point of how people and/or ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, and commonly applies global-scale scenario information or refine this to the region of interest through downscaling procedures. Conversely, in the bottom-up approach the development context is the starting point, focusing on local scales, and layers"}

Also Gong et al. do not find a link between Rossby wave propagation into the midlatitudes and Arctic sea ice loss. Mori et al. argue that models underestimate the influence of the Barents-Kara Sea ice loss on the atmosphere, which is disputed by Screen and Blackport. Other studies have stressed the importance of atmospheric variability as a driver of Arctic variability. Analysing observed key variables of mid-latitude climate for 1980-2020, Blackport and Screen and Riboldi et al. argue that the Arctic influence on mid-latitudes is small compared to other aspects of climate variability, and that observed periods of strong correlation are an artefact of internal variability or intermittency. An additional argument in the criticism is the inability of climate models to simulate a significant response to Arctic sea-ice loss, larger than the natural variability, although some studies find a significant response in summer, because then the internal variability is weaker. Finally, a warmer Arctic climate can, without any additional changes in atmospheric dynamics, reduce cold extremes in winter due to advection of increasingly warmer air from the Arctic into the mid-latitudes. Summarizing, different hypotheses have been developed about the influence of recent Arctic warming on the mid-latitudes in both winter and summer. Although some of the proposed mechanisms seem to be supported by various studies, such as the link with Barents-Kara Sea ice loss in winter and weakened storm tracks in summer, the underlying mechanisms and relative strength compared to internal climate variability have been questioned. A recent review states that divergent conclusions between model and observational studies, and also between different model studies, continue to obfuscate a clear understanding of how Arctic warming is influencing mid-latitude weather. In this context, Shepherd stresses the need for collaboration between scientists with different viewpoints for further understanding that could be achived by carefully designed, multi-investigator, coordinated, multi-model simulations, data analyses and diagnostics. In agreement with Box 3.2 of SROCC, there is hence low to medium confidence in the exact role and quantitative effect of historical Arctic warming and sea-ice loss on midlatitude atmospheric variability. Regarding future climate, it is important to note that mid-latitude variability is also affected by many drivers other than the Arctic changes and that those drivers as well as the linkages to mid-latitude variability might change in a warmer world. The AMV, PDV, ENSO, upper tropospheric tropical heating, polar stratospheric vortex, and land-surface processes associated with soil moisture are a few examples. A considerable body of literature has shown that changes to the NAO/AO on seasonal and climate change time scales can be driven by variations in the wavelength and amplitude of Rossby waves, mainly of tropical origin. The influence of future Arctic warming on mid-latitude circulation is difficult to disentangle from the effect of such a plethora of drivers. One of the consequences of climate change is a poleward shift of the jet induced by the tropical warming, which is less obvious in winter especially over the North Atlantic, and the increase of the meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere, which increases storm track activity. Although climate models indicate that future Arctic warming and the associated equator-pole temperature gradient could affect mid-latitude climate and variability, and even the tropics and sub-tropics, they do not reveal a strong influence on extreme weather. In conclusion, there is low confidence in the relative contribution of Arctic warming to mid-latitude atmospheric changes compared to other drivers. Future climate change could affect mid-latitude variability in a number of ways that are still to be clarified, and which may also include the influence of Arctic warming. The linkages between the Arctic warming and the mid-latitude circulation is an example of"}

While an assessment of large-scale observations can be found in Chapter 2, this section discusses the specific aspects of the observations at regional scale and over the typological regions considered in the regional chapters. This section focuses on land regions and does not consider the specific requirements of ocean observations. 10.2.1 Observation Types and Their Use at Regional Scale 10.2.1.1 In situ and remote-sensing data Surface or in situ observations can come from a variety of networks: climate reference networks, mesoscale weather and supersite observation networks, citizen science networks, among others, all with their strengths and weaknesses. Supersite observatories are surface and atmospheric boundary layer observing networks that measure a large number of atmospheric and soil variables at least hourly over a decade or more, ideally located in rural areas. Adequate calibration of instruments, quality control and homogenization are essential in these sites. They produce valuable data needed to diagnose processes and changes in regional and local climate. Several climate datasets have been developed from in situ station observations, at different spatial scales and temporal frequencies. These include sub-daily, daily, or monthly time scales. Sub-daily data is useful for estimating storm surge or river discharge, daily data for carbon-stock dynamics or tourism, and monthly data for beach morphology. Satellite products provide a valuable complement to in situ measurements, particularly over regions where in situ measurements are unavailable. They have been discussed in earlier chapters for large-scale assessment. Currently 54 essential climate variables are defined by the Global Climate Observing System program, and passed on, for example, to NASA programmes through the Decadal Survey, to the Copernicus Climate Change Service of the European Union, to the ESA Climate Change Initiative ESA-CCI, as well as to the international collaborations with geostationary Earthorbit satellites. Their observations are valuable for regional applications since they provide multi-channel images at very high spatiotemporal resolutions, typically 16 channels, 12 km, every 10 to 15 minutes. The advanced geostationary satellites are: Himawari-8 and 9, GOES-East and GOES-17, Meteosat-10 and 11 and FY-4. Geostationary satellite networks or constellations form an essential component of the Global Observation System, providing measurements not only for various cloud properties and moisture but also for air quality, land and ocean surface conditions, and lightning. Low Earth-orbit satellites, with orbits typically at 400-700 km, provide advanced measurements of the Earths surface. Sun-synchronous polar orbiters can also cover the polar regions, which cannot be observed with GEO satellites. Examples of LEO observations for land-surface monitoring are NASAs"}

Most global observational datasets are available at coarse temporal and spatial resolution, and do not include all available station data from a particular region, due to data availability problems. Therefore, efforts have been made to develop regional or country-scale datasets. Radar and satellite remote sensing are resources that can provide a valuable complement to direct measurements at regional scale. Examples for precipitation have been described already, some of which have been released to the community. However, some of these datasets are limited by their short record, varying between one and 64 years. Reanalysis products are numerical climate simulations that use data assimilation to incorporate as many irregular observations as possible. These products encompass many physical and dynamical processes. They generate a coherent estimate of the state of the climate system on uniform grids either at global, regional or country scales. Reanalyses incorporate an increasing volume of observations from a growing number of sources over time, which sometimes presents a difficulty for trend analysis. However, regional reanalyses are valuable for regional climate assessments, since they can employ high-resolution model simulations due to their limited spatial domain. Their accuracy is also better than global reanalyses since they are often developed over regions with a high density of observational data to be assimilated into the model. Regional reanalyses can assimilate locally dense and high-frequency observations, such as from local observation networks and radar precipitation in addition to the observations assimilated by global reanalyses. In some regional reanalyses, satellite-derived high-resolution sea ice and sea surface temperature are also applied as lower boundary conditions. The periods of regional reanalyses are limited by the availability of the observations for assimilation and by the global reanalyses needed as lateral boundary conditions. Most regional reanalyses cover the past 10 to 30 years. There are also regional reanalysis activities that use conventional observations only, which produce consistent datasets over 60 years to capture precipitation trends, extremes and changes. Existing regional reanalyses cover North America, Europe, the Arctic, South Asia, and Australia. A project for regional reanalysis covering Japan has also started, where grid spacing is between 5 and 32 km, although cumulus parameterizations are still needed to compute sub-grid scale cumulus convection. Recently, reanalyses using convection-permitting regional models have been published. The data assimilation schemes used in regional reanalyses are often relatively simple methods, specifically nudging and 3DVAR, rather than the more complex schemes implemented in state-of-the-art global reanalysis systems. This is partly due to limitations of computational resources. Recently, a number of regional reanalyses using more sophisticated methods, such as 4DVAR and Ensemble Kalman filter, have been published. The regional reanalyses also incorporate uncertainties due to deficiencies of the models, data assimilation schemes and observations. To estimate uncertainties, some regional reanalyses apply data assimilation using ensemble forecasts. Another approach compares multiple regional reanalyses produced with different systems covering the same domain, which represents the uncertainties better than single reanalysis systems with"}

The regional reanalyses represent the frequencies of extremes and the distributions of precipitation, surface air temperature, and surface wind better than global reanalyses. This is due to the use of high-resolution regional climate models, as indicated by different regional climate modelling studies. Regional reanalyses, however, retain uncertainties due to deficiencies in the physical parametrization used in RCMs and by the use of relatively simple data assimilation algorithms. Regional reanalyses can provide estimates that are more consistent with observations than dynamical downscaling approaches, due to the assimilation of additional local observations. 10.2.2 Challenges for Regional Climate Change Assessment 10.2.2.1 Quality control The usefulness of any observational dataset is conditioned by the availability and outcome of a quality control process. The objective of the QC is to verify that data are representative of the measured variable and to what degree the value could be contaminated by unrelated or conflicting factors. Data quality assessment is key for ensuring that the data are credible and to establish trusted relationships between the data provider and the users. QC is performed for all relevant global climate datasets. For instance, QC informs users that old reanalysis datasets can be inconsistent in the long term because they assimilated inhomogeneous observations over the reanalyses period. As a consequence, the evaluation against independent observations suggests that reanalyses should not be automatically regarded as climate-quality products for monitoring long-term trends at the regional level. QC needs to be systematically carried out by the institutions responsible for handling the data. The QC procedure depends strongly on the specific nature of the dataset. It focuses on aspects such as the correct identification of sensor, time and location, detection of unfeasible or inconsistent data, error estimation, assessment of the adequacy of the uncertainty information and the adequacy of the documentation. QC principles also apply to model data. An important piece of information provided is the representativeness error. When problems in the data representativeness are identified, observational datasets are provided with a quality mask, or the problematic data are either removed or corrected. These are factors often taken into account in constructing regional climate information. Quality-controlled data are now produced widely at the regional level, as in the case of sub-daily precipitation records in the United Kingdom and the USA. However, many more datasets and variables lack the same level of scrutiny. Qualitycontrolled, high-resolution observational datasets are especially needed at regional and local scales to assess models as their resolution increases, although the awareness and appropriate use of the QC information is challenging when generating regional climate information. 10.2.2.2 Homogenization Homogenization aims to make data spatially and temporally homogeneous. Changes in a homogeneous time series are solely due to large-scale climatic changes. Station data are influenced by factors that act at regional scales, from the mesoscale and local scale down to the microscale. Station time series contain inhomogeneities such as artificial jumps or trends,"}

There has been very little evaluation of the performance of classical and data mining methods. The classical methods include the arithmetic mean, inverse-distance weighting method, multipleregression analysis, multiple imputation, and single-best estimator, while the data-mining methods include multiple-perceptron artificial neural network, support-vector machine, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, gene-expression programming method, and K-nearest neighbour. Crowd-sourced data could play a role in minimizing data scarcity. 10.2.2.4 Gridding Derived gridded datasets require merging data from different sources of observations and/or reanalysis data on a regular grid. However, in situ observations are distributed irregularly, especially over sparsely populated areas. This leads to an interpolation challenge. Gridded products of climate variables, including temperature and precipitation, are strongly affected by the interpolation method over complex orography and data scarce regions. There are two main approaches to produce gridded datasets: based on in situ observations only, and combining in situ observations with remote-sensing data and/or reanalysis data. The first approach has been widely employed in regions with high station density using interpolation techniques. The second approach has been mainly applied in data-sparse regions with low station density, using simple bias adjustment, quantile mapping, and kriging techniques with in situ observations, remote-sensing and reanalysis data. Gridding of station data is affected by uncertainties stemming from measurement errors, inhomogeneities, the distribution of the underlying stations and the interpolation error, with station density being the dominant factor. Uncertainty due to interpolation is typically small for temperature but substantial for precipitation and its derivatives, such as drought indices. The largest uncertainties typically occur in sparsely sampled mountain areas. Interpolation generally give rise to smoothing effects, such as low variability of the derived dataset with respect to the in situ observations. As a result, the effective resolution of gridded data is typically much lower than its nominal resolution. For instance, a 5 km gridded precipitation dataset for the European Alps has an effective resolution of about 10 to 25 km. In an example for precipitation in Spain, the effective resolution converged to the nominal resolution only when at least 6 to 7 stations were inside the grid cell. To account for the smoothing errors, new stochastic ensemble observation datasets have been introduced. 10.2.2.5 Observations in mountain areas Spatiotemporal variability of meteorological parameters observed over mountainous areas is often large, indicating strong control exerted by local topography on meteorological parameters. Difficult access, harsh climatic conditions as well as instrumental issues make meteorological measurements extremely challenging at higher elevations. Measurements of wind speed, temperature, relative humidity and radiative fluxes are critical for climate model evaluation, but difficult to handle due to their point-scale representativeness and small-scale spatiotemporal variability over mountainous terrain, and often need adjustment. High-altitude permanent meteorological stations are limited and current knowledge is mainly based on valley-bottom or low-elevation meteorological stations, which, generally do not represent the higher elevation climate."}

They all require observational data for calibration as well as evaluation. Typically, the so-called perfect prognosis methods use quasi-observations for the predictors and actual observations for the predictands. By contrast, bias adjustment methods use observations only for the predictands. Weather generators typically require only observed predictands, although some are conditioned on observed predictors as well. Very often these methods are based on daily data, because of user needs, but also because of the limited availability of sub-daily observations and the limited ability of climate models to realistically simulate sub-daily weather. Some methods are calibrated on the monthly scale, but some of the generated time series are then further disaggregated to the daily scale. A few methods, mainly weather generators, represent sub-daily weather. Many methods simulate temperature and precipitation only, although some also represent wind, radiation and other variables. The limited availability of high quality and long observational records typically restricts these applications to a few cases. Overall, there is high confidence that limited availability of station observations, including variables beyond temperature and precipitation as well as sub-daily data, limit the use of statistical modelling of regional climate. All the limitations and challenges of observational data discussed in Section 10.2.2 also apply to its use for post-processing of climate model data. High quality and long observational data series are particularly relevant to quantify uncertainties. Different reanalyses present significant discrepancies when used as key predictor variables at the daily scale and may even affect the downscaled climate change signal. There is high confidence that reanalysis uncertainties limit the quality of statistical downscaling in some regions, although no assessment has been made for the most recent reanalysis products. An important issue for bias adjustment is the correct representation of the required spatial scale. Ideally, bias adjustment is calibrated against area-averaged data of the same spatial scale as the climate model output. Hence, high-quality observed gridded datasets with an effective resolution close to the nominal model resolution are required. Driven by the need to also generate regional-scale information in station-sparse regions, researchers have considered derived datasets that blend in situ and remote sensing data to produce high-resolution observations to be used as predictands. 10.2.3.2 Observation for paleoclimate data assimilation Following some early concept studies, the first practical applications of paleoclimate data assimilation over past centuries used only selected data to reconstruct past climate changes for analysis of a specific process or case. Recently, assimilation of multiple series from various data sources, including tree rings, ice cores, lake cores, corals, and bivalves, has allowed production of reconstructions that can be widely shared and applied to multiple purposes, as with modern reanalyses. Most of these paleo-reanalyses are global but there are products using regional models or targeted at specific regions such as Europe, East Africa and the Indian Ocean. Paleo-reanalyses are enabling a new range of applications and have already provided useful information on seasonal-to-multidecadal climate variability over past millennia. They are useful tools to study the covariance between variables at interannual-to-centennial time scales and at regional to global spatial scales. In particular, they have highlighted the processes that can be responsible for changes in continental hydrology at multi-decadal time scales."}

For AR6, several of the new CMIP6 model intercomparison projects address some of these limitations. The list of MIPs is provided in Chapter 1. HighResMIP and GMMIP) specifically address the regional climate challenge using global models. HighResMIP focuses on producing global climate projections at a horizontal resolution of around 50 km grid spacing or finer while GMMIP aims at better understanding and predicting the monsoons. An alternative to increasing resolution everywhere is offered by variable resolution global models, that is, with regionally finer resolution. They have been developed since the 1970s, resulting in a first coordinated effort by Fox-Rabinovitz et al.,. They are expected to offer the finest resolution possible in the region of interest, while still resolving the climate processes at the global scale. An overview of recent developments is in McGregor. This is a rapidly developing field that will possibly contribute to improved future regional projections. 10.3.1.2 RCMs RCMs are dynamical models similar to GCMs that are applied over a limited area, but with a horizontal resolution higher than that of standard GCMs. They are the basis for dynamical downscaling to produce subcontinental climate information but are also often used for process understanding. At lateral and, if applicable, lower boundaries, RCMs take their values from a driving data set, which could be a GCM or a reanalysis. RCMs are typically one-way nested: they do not feed back into the driving model, although two-way nested GCM-RCM simulations have been performed that examine regional influence on large-scale climate, potentially improving it. Spectral nudging can increase consistency with the driving model, whereby selected variables, such as the wind field, are forced to closely follow a prescribed large-scale field over a specified range of spatial scales. RCMs can inherit biases from the driving GCM in addition to producing biases themselves. The consistency between the circulation features simulated by the RCM and those inherited through the boundary conditions depends on 1) the relative importance of the large-scale forcing compared to local-scale phenomena, and 2) the size of the RCM domain. Large domains also allow the RCM to generate much of its own internally generated unforced variability. The CORDEX initiative provides ensembles of high-resolution historical and future climate projections for various regions. RCMs in CORDEX typically have a horizontal resolution between 10 and 50 km. But much finer spatial resolution is required to fully resolve deep convection, an important cause of precipitation in much of the world. Therefore, an emerging strand in dynamical downscaling employs simulations at convection permitting scales, at horizontal resolutions of a few kilometres, where deep-convection parameterisations can be switched off, approximately simulating deep convection. A recent study indicates that switching off the deep-convection parameterization may be beneficial also in simulations performed at coarser resolutions. Alternatively, some RCMs make use of scale-aware parameterizations that are able to adapt to increasing resolution without switching off the convection scheme. RCMs have often consisted of atmospheric and land components that do not include all possible Earthsystem processes and therefore neglect important processes such as air-sea coupling or the chemistry of cloud-"}

Therefore, some RCMs have been extended by coupling to additional components like interactive oceans, sometimes with sea ice, rivers, glaciers, and aerosols. The coupling of these components allows for the investigation of additional climate processes such as regional sea-level change, oceanland interactions, or the impact of high-frequency ocean-atmosphere coupling on the climatology of Mediterranean cyclones. 10.3.1.3 Statistical approaches to generate regional climate projections An alternative or addition to dynamical downscaling is the use of statistical approaches to generate regional projections. In AR5 these methods were collectively referred to as statistical downscaling, but their performance assessment has received little attention. A major conclusion was that a wide range of different methods exist and a general assessment of their performance is difficult. Since AR5, several initiatives have been launched to improve the understanding of statistical approaches such as VALUE, STARMIP and BADJAM. The performance of different implementations of these approaches will be assessed in Section 10.3.3.7. 10.3.1.3.1 Perfect prognosis Perfect-prognosis models are statistical models calibrated between observation-based large-scale predictors and observed local-scale predictands. Regional climate projections are then generated by replacing the quasi-observed predictors by those from climate model projections. Predictor patterns that are common to observations and climate model data can be defined by common empirical orthogonal functions. The perfect prognosis approach can either be used to generate daily time series, or local weather statistics. Regression-like models rely on a transfer function linking an observed local statistic to some set of large-scale predictors. Recent developments include stochastic regression models to explicitly simulate local variability. The use of machine learning techniques has been reinvigorated, including genetic programming to construct a data-driven model structure and deep and convolutional neural networks. Analogue methods compare a simulated large-scale atmospheric field with an archive of observations and select, using some distance metric, the closest observed field in the archive. The downscaled atmospheric field is then chosen as the local atmospheric field observed on the instant the analogue occurred. New analogue methods have been developed to simulate unobserved values including a rescaling of the analogue or by combining analogues and regression models. 10.3.1.3.2 Bias adjustment Bias adjustment is a statistical post-processing technique used to pragmatically reduce the mismatch between the statistics of climate model output and observations. The approach estimates the bias or relative error between a chosen simulated statistical property and that observed over a calibration period; the simulated statistic is then adjusted taking into account the simulated deviation.

Typical implementations of bias adjustment are additive adjustments, where the model data is adjusted by adding a constant, rescaling, where the model data is adjusted by a factor, and more flexible quantile mapping approaches that adjust different ranges of a distribution individually. Hempel et al., Pierce et al., Switanek et al., and developed variants of quantile mapping that preserve trends in the mean or even further distributional statistics. Multivariate bias adjustment extends univariate methods, which adjust statistics of individual variables separately, to joint adjustment of multiple variables simultaneously. Implementations remove biases in specific measures of multivariate dependence, like correlation structure, via linear transformations, or, more flexibly, the full multivariate distribution via nonlinear transformations. Other research strands focus on the explicit separation of bias adjustment and downscaling, or the integration of process understanding, such as by conditioning the adjustment on the occurrence of relevant phenomena. Some authors suggest to mitigate the influence of large-scale temperature or circulation biases by performing a bias adjustment of the driving fields prior to dynamical downscaling. Issues that may arise when using bias adjustment are discussed in Cross-Chapter Box 10.2. 10.3.1.3.3 Delta-change approaches In the delta change approach, selected observations are modified according to corresponding changes derived from dynamical model simulations. Traditionally, only long term means have been adjusted, but recently approaches to modify temporal dependence have been developed, as well as quantile mapping approaches that individually adjust quantiles of the observed distribution. By construction, the approach cannot modify the spatial and temporal dependence structure of the input observations. 10.3.1.3.4 Weather generators Weather generators are statistical models that simulate weather time series of arbitrary length. They are calibrated to represent observed weather statistics, in particular daily or even sub-daily variability. One variant of these models are advanced stochastic perfect-prognosis methods, conditioned on large-scale atmospheric predictors on a daily basis, for instance multi-site generalised linear models. Another widely used variant is change-factor weather generators: the weather generator parameters are calibrated against present and future climate model simulations, and the climate change signals are then applied to the parameters calibrated to observations. Recent research has mainly focussed on multi-site Richardson type weather generators, some explicitly modelling extremes and their spatial dependence. 10.3.1.3.5 Hybrid approaches and emulators A wide variety of approaches has been proposed to combine the advantages of different statistical approaches. For instance, to overcome the scale mismatch between climate model output and observations, bias adjustment has been combined with stochastic downscaling or rescaled analogues. Other approaches known as emulators have been developed to emulate an RCM using a statistical model and also applied to a range of driving global models. 10.3.2 Types of Model Experiments The most commonly used model experiments to generate regional climate information are transient simulations. Alternative experiment types serve specific purposes. The role of these experiment types for"}

They are typically based on coupled global model simulations, such as those in the DECK and ScenarioMIP part of CMIP6 covering the period 18502100, and HighResMIP. Global transient climate simulations may be further downscaled by either dynamical or statistical downscaling. Currently available CORDEX RCM simulations are based on CMIP5. In contrast, time-slice experiments are designed to represent only a specific period of time. They are often run using global and regional models in atmosphere-only mode, forced by SSTs derived either from observations, as AMIP experiments, or from historical simulations and future projections of coupled global models. Compared to transient simulations, they offer advantages in being computationally cheaper, which allows for the number of ensemble members, and/or the resolution to be increased. Convection-permitting simulations, both covering the globe or particular regions, are currently conducted for short time slices only. Another high-resolution time-slice data base is d4PDF. Experiments covering a limited integration period have been carried out for coupled oceanatmosphere RCMs. However, long spin-up periods are required to reach a stable stationary state in the deep ocean that otherwise might lead to invalid projections. 10.3.2.2 Pseudo-global warming experiments Results from downscaling experiments often suffer from large-scale circulation biases in the driving GCMs such as misplaced storm tracks, while changes in atmospheric circulation are often uncertain owing to both climate response uncertainty and internal variability. In a given application, if one can assume that changes in the regional climate are dominated by thermodynamic rather than by circulation changes, so-called pseudo-global warming experiments may be helpful in mitigating the effects of circulation biases, and to fix the large-scale circulation to present climate. In classical PGW experiments, boundary conditions for the downscaling are taken from reanalysis data, but modified according to the thermodynamic signals of climate change. The boundary conditions thus represent the sequence of observed weather, but with adjusted temperatures, humidity and atmospheric stability. Recent applications of PGW experiments include assessments of climate change in Japan, the Los Angeles area, Hawaii, and the Alps. Recently, PGW studies have been generalised to modify global model simulations with the objective of separating the drivers of regional climate change, such as the Mediterranean amplification. Equivalent simulations can be conducted for individual events, thereby allowing for very high resolution. With counterfactual past climate conditions, such simulations can be used for conditional event attribution, using hypothetical future conditions to generate physical climate storylines of how specific events may manifest in a warmer climate. The approach has been employed to study extreme events that require very high resolution simulations such as tropical cyclones or convective precipitation events. The range of possible events is broader and has included Korean heat waves and monsoon onset in West Africa. However, if only individual events are simulated, no immediate conclusions can be derived for changes to the occurrence probability of these events."}

Although the reanalysis model itself can introduce biases especially for non-assimilated variables it is assumed that in such a setting, discrepancies between the modelled and observed climate arise mostly from errors in the downscaling method or internal climate variability generated by the downscaling method. Since AR5, reanalysis-driven RCMs have been extensively evaluated for many regions, especially in the CORDEX framework. Over Europe, the VALUE initiative assessed statistical downscaling for marginal, temporal, and spatial aspects of temperature and precipitation including extremes, and performed a process-based evaluation of specific climatic phenomena. Alternatively, statistical downscaling can be evaluated in so-called perfect model or pseudo-reality simulations, where a high-resolution climate model simulation is used as a proxy for a hypothetical present and future realities. A statistical downscaling model is first calibrated with this pseudo present-day climate and, subsequently, assessed whether it correctly reproduces the pseudo-future conditions. 10.3.3 Model Performance and Added Value in Simulating and Projecting Regional Climate Assessing model performance is a prerequisite for building confidence in regional climate projections. This subsection assesses the performance of different model types at simulating regional climate and climate change. The subsection builds on the assessment of global model performance in Chapter 3, and complements the model assessment in Chapter 8, which focuses on the water cycle, and the Atlas.

Users demand regional climate projections for decision making and have high expectations regarding accuracy and resolution, but some scientists consider such projections still a matter of basic research. For instance, large-scale circulation biases or the misrepresentation of regional topography as well as regional phenomena and feedbacks are very relevant. New global model ensembles such as CMIP6, HighResMIP or, at the regional scale, the convection permitting simulations from the CORDEX Flagship Pilot Study on convective phenomena have the potential to substantially improve the basis for generating regional climate information, yet uncertainties and contradictions between model projections at the regional scale can be substantial. Figure 10.6 shows the mean summer temperature and precipitation biases of several state-of-the-art climate model ensembles for the western Mediterranean. It additionally illustrates the role of observational uncertainty for model evaluation, where observations display differences that can be substantial. Model performance varies strongly from model to model, but also between ensembles. These biases are an expression of model error that leads to misrepresented phenomena and processes, and thus limit the confidence in future projections of regional climate. The focus of this subsection is therefore to evaluate the representation of relevant regional scale phenomena for representing regional climate. 10.3.3.1 Evaluation diagnostics Since AR5, model evaluation has made use of a broad combination of diagnostics, ranging from long-term means to indices of extreme events or a combination of these. This evaluation has shown that global models have pervasive biases in some aspects of their large-scale behaviour. More complex diagnostics are used to characterize specific meteorological phenomena, such as feedbacks in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Madden-Julian Oscillation characteristics, extra-tropical modes of variability, cyclone tracking, front detection, thunderstorm environment parameters, African easterly waves, land-atmosphere coupling, and sea-atmosphere coupling. New diagnostics for multivariate dependencies are needed to characterize compound events. However, their success depends on the availability of adequate observational data. Multivariate dependencies discovered in compound events can also be used for designing and evaluating multivariate bias adjustment and statistical downscaling. Processbased diagnostics are useful for identifying the cause of model errors, although it is not always possible to associate a systematic error with a specific cause. AR5 discussed two approaches of process-based evaluation: 1) the isolation of physical components or parameterizations by dedicated experiments and 2) diagnostics conditioned on relevant regimes, usually synoptic-scale weather patterns. The regime-based approach has been used with both global models and RCMs, but also with perfect prognosis and bias adjustment methods. Recent studies highlight the importance of user-defined or user-relevant diagnostics for model evaluation. Diagnostics have been"}

Alternatively, the observed impact can be compared to that simulated by an impact model that uses input from both observations and climate models. This approach has been used to evaluate the influence of statistical downscaling and bias adjustment on hydrological, agricultural, forest and wildfire, snow depth, and regional ocean modelling. There is high confidence that to assess whether a climate model realistically simulates required aspects of present-day regional climate, and to increase confidence of future projections of these aspects, evaluation needs to be based on diagnostics taking into account multiple variables and process-understanding. 10.3.3.2 Model improvement and added value Obtaining regional information from global simulations may involve a range of different methods. An approach with higher complexity or resolution is useful if it adds further, useful information to that of a reference model. Section 10.5 discusses the set of considerations that determine if the information is useful. This further useful information is often referred to as added value and is a function of variables, processes, and the temporal and spatial scales targeted taking into account the needs of specific users. There is no common definition of added value, but here it is considered a characteristic that arises when one methodology gives further value to what another methodology yields. Downscaling is expected to improve the representation of a regions climate compared to the driving GCM. Arguably, there should be a clear physical reason for the improvement, which is applicable to the evaluation of added value in downscaled projections. The added value depends on the region, season, and governing physical processes. Thus, added value of downscaling GCM simulations is most likely where regionaland local-scale processes play an important role in a regions climate, for example in complex or heterogeneous terrain such as mountains, urban areas, along coastlines, or where convective processes are important. Examples of model improvements and added value are given in the following subsections and the Atlas. A first step in determining added value in downscaling is to analyse whether the downscaling procedure gives detail on spatial or temporal scales not well-resolved by a GCM, thus potentially representing climatic features missing in the GCM. This added detail, referred to as potential added value, is insufficient for demonstrating added value in downscaling, but lack of PAV indicates that the downscaling method lacks usefulness. Added value is not guaranteed simply by producing model output at finer resolution. It depends on several factors, such as the simulation setup and the specific climatic variables analysed. A variety of performance measures are needed to assess added value. A further challenge, especially at increasingly higher resolutions, is that adequate observational data may not be available to assess added value. This implies a need for additional efforts to obtain, catalogue and quality-control higher resolution observational data sets. Univariate demonstration of added value is necessary, but may be insufficient, as better agreement with observations in the downscaled variable may be a consequence of compensating errors that are not guaranteed to compensate similarly as climate changes. Multivariate analysis of added value is better able to demonstrate physical consistency between observed and simulated behaviour."}

In particular extreme events are often caused by specific, in some cases persistent, circulation patterns. It is therefore important for climate models to reasonably represent not only continental, but also regional climate and its variability for such extremes. As explained in Section 3.3.3, standard resolution GCMs can suffer biases in the location, occurrence frequency or intensity of large-scale phenomena, such that statements about a specific regional climate and its change can be highly uncertain. RCMs have difficulties improving especially large-scale circulation biases, although some successful examples exist. But due to their enhanced representation of complex topography and coastlines, RCMs may add value to simulating the regional expression of teleconnections. Bias adjustment cannot mitigate fundamental misrepresentations of the largescale atmospheric circulation. This subsection illustrates the relevance of large-scale circulation biases for regional climate assessments with selected examples from the mid-to-high latitudes and tropics. 10.3.3.3.1 Mid-to-high latitude atmospheric variability phenomena: blocking and extratropical cyclones Major large-scale meteorological phenomena for mid-to-high latitude mean and extreme climate include atmospheric blocking and extratropical cyclones. Atmospheric blocking is characterized by a quasi-stationary long-lasting, high pressure system that blocks and diverts the movement of synoptic cyclones. In regions where blocking occurs, it is known to lead to cold conditions in winter and warmth and drought during summer, defining the seasonal regional climate in certain years. Extratropical cyclones are storm systems that propagate preferentially in confined storm-track regions, characterized by large eddy-kinetic energy, heat and momentum transports that shape regional weather at mid-to-high latitudes. Given their importance in shaping mean and extreme regional climate, an accurate representation of blocking and extratropical cyclones in global and regional climate models is needed to better understand regional climate variability and extremes as well as to project future changes. An overview of CMIP5 and CMIP6 model performance in simulating blocking and extratropical cyclones is given in Section 3.3.3.3. CMIP6 models still suffer from long-standing blocking biases identified in previous generations of models. However, blocking location has improved compared to CMIP5, while comparable performance is seen for blocking frequency and persistence. Increasing horizontal model resolution to about 20 km in the HighResMIP experiments improves the representation of blocking frequency and its spatial pattern in most models, but no clear effect could be shown for blocking persistence. Biases associated with these two phenomena are highly regionand season-dependent and their amplitudes vary among CMIP models.

Using this approach, downscaling of precipitation is particularly skilful in the presence of strong orographic forcing. The representation of daily variability and extremes requires analogue methods or stochastic regression models, although the former typically do not extrapolate to unobserved values. Temporal precipitation variability is well represented by analogue methods and stochastic regression, but analogue methods typically underestimate temporal dependence of temperature. Spatial dependence of both temperature and precipitation is only well represented by analogue methods, for which analogues are defined jointly across locations, and by stochastic regression methods explicitly representing spatial dependence. Overall, there is high confidence that analogue methods and stochastic regression are able to represent many aspects of daily temperature and variability, but the analogue method is inherently limited in representing climate change. 10.3.3.7.2 Performance of bias adjustment methods This subsection assesses the performance of bias adjustment in a perfect predictor context. In practice, climate model imperfections may cause substantial additional issues in the application of bias adjustment. These are assessed separately in Cross-Chapter Box 10.2. Bias adjustment methods, if driven by reanalysis predictors, in principle adjust well all the aspects that they intend to address. For temperature, all univariate methods are good for adjusting means, variance, and high quantiles. For precipitation, means, intensities, wet-day frequencies, and wet-dry and dry-wet transitions are well adjusted. The representation of high quantiles depends on the chosen method, although flexible quantile mapping performs best. Empirical methods perform better than parametric methods over the observed range, but it is unclear how this translates into extrapolation to unobserved values. Many quantile mapping methods overestimate interannual variability. Temporal and spatial dependence are usually not adjusted and thus inherited from the driving model. Spatial fields are thus typically too smooth in space, even after bias adjustment. Several studies show improved simulations of present day impacts, when the impact model is fed with biasadjusted climate model output, including the assessment of river discharge, forest fires, crop production, and regional ocean modelling. There is high confidence that bias adjustment can improve the marginal distribution of simulated climate variables, if applied to a climate model that adequately represents the processes relevant for a given application. 10.3.3.7.3 Performance of weather generators Weather generators represent well most aspects that are explicitly calibrated. This typically includes mean, variance, high quantiles, and short-term temporal variability for both temperature and precipitation, whereas interannual variability is strongly underestimated (Frost et al.,"}

There is growing evidence that some spatial weather generators fairly realistically capture the spatial dependence of temperature and precipitation. There is high confidence that weather generators can realistically simulate a wide range of local weather characteristics at single locations, but there is limited evidence and low agreement of the ability of weather generators to realistically simulate the spatial dependence of atmospheric variables across multiple sites. 10.3.3.8 Performance at simulating historical regional climate changes This section assesses how well climate models perform at realistically simulating historical regional climatic trends. Current global model ensembles reproduce global to continental-scale surface temperature trends at multi-decadal to centennial time scales, but underestimate precipitation trends. For regional trends, AR5 concluded that the CMIP5 ensemble cannot be taken as a reliable representation of reality and that the true uncertainty can be larger than the simulated model spread. Case studies of regional trend simulations by global models can be found in Sections 10.4.1 and 10.6, and region-by-region assessments in the Atlas. A key limitation for assessing the representation of regional observed trends by single transient simulations of global models is the strong amplitude of internal variability compared to the forced signal at the regional scale. Even on multidecadal time scales, an agreement between observed and individual simulated trends would be expected to occur only by chance. In the context of downscaling, the ability of downscaling methods to reproduce observed trends when driven with boundary conditions or predictors taken from reanalysis data can be assessed. For temperature in the continental USA, reanalysis-driven RCMs skilfully simulated recent spring and winter trends, but did not reproduce summer and autumn trends,. Over Central America, observed warming trends were reproduced. In contrast, a reanalysis-driven coupled atmosphere-ocean RCM covering the Mediterranean could not reproduce the observed SST trend. Similar studies have been carried out for statistical downscaling and bias adjustment using predictors from reanalyses. For a range of different perfect prognosis methods, Huth et al. found that simulated temperature trends were too strong for winter and too weak for summer. The performance was similar for the different methods, indicating the importance of choosing sensible predictors. Similarly, Maraun et al. found that the performance of perfect prognosis methods depends mostly on the predictor and domain choice. Bias adjustment methods reproduced the trends of the driving reanalysis, apart from quantile mapping methods, which deteriorated these trends. RCM experiments are often set up such that changes in forcing agents are included only via the boundary conditions, but not explicitly included inside the domain. Jerez et al. demonstrated that not including time-varying GHG concentrations within the RCM domain may misrepresent temperature trends by 12oC per century. Including the past trend in anthropogenic sulphate aerosols in reanalysis-driven RCM simulations substantially improved the representation of recent brightening and warming trends in Europe. Similarly, Bukovsky argued that RCMs may not capture observed summer temperature trends in the USA because changes in land cover are not taken into account. Barlage et al. have revealed that including the behaviour of groundwater in land schemes increases the performance of an RCM model to represent climate variability in the central USA. Hamdi et al. found that an RCM that did not incorporate the historical urbanization in the land-use, land-cover scheme is not able to reproduce the warming trend observed in urban stations, with a larger bias for the minimum temperature trend. Overall, there is high confidence that including all relevant forcings is a prerequisite for reproducing"}

A climate models credibility for future projections may be increased if the model is able to simulate past variations in climate. In particular, the credibility of downscaled information depends on the quality of both the downscaling method and of the global model providing the large-scale boundary conditions. Credibility is closely linked to the concept of adequacy or fitness for purpose. From a regional perspective, one may ask about the fitness of a climate model for simulating future changes of specific aspects of a specific regional climate. The required level of model fitness may depend on the user context. A key challenge is to link performance at representing present and past climate to the confidence in future projections and it is addressed in this subsection. A general idea of model fitness for a given application may be obtained by checking whether relevant large(Section 10.3.3.4) and regional-scale processes are explicitly resolved. The basis for confidence in climate projection is a solid process understanding. Thus, the key to assessing the fitness for purpose of a model is the evaluation of how relevant processes controlling regional climate are represented. A process-based evaluation may be more appropriate than an evaluation of the variables of interest, because biases in the latter may in principle be reduced if the underlying processes are realistically simulated, while individual variables may appear as well represented because of compensating errors. Combining a process-based evaluation with a mechanistic explanation of projected changes further increases confidence in projections. Fitness-for-purpose can also be assessed by comparing the simulated response of a model with simulations of higher resolution models that better represent relevant processes. For instance, Giorgi et al. have corroborated their findings on precipitation changes comparing standard RCM simulations with convection-permitting simulations. The evaluation of model performance at historical variability and long-term changes provides further relevant information. Trend evaluation may provide very useful insight, but has limitations in particular at the regional scale, mainly due to multi-decadal internal climate variability, observational uncertainty, and the fact that often not all regional forcings are known, and that past trends may be driven by forcings other than those driving future trends. Increasing resolution or performing downscaling may be particularly important when it modifies the climate change signal of a lower resolution model in a physically plausible way. Improvements may result from a better representation of regional processes, upscale effects, as well as the possibility of a region-specific model tuning. For instance, Gula and Peltier showed that a higher resolution allows for a more realistic simulation of lake-induced precipitation, resulting in a more credible projection of changes in the snow belts of the North American Great Lakes. Similarly, Giorgi et al. demonstrated that an ensemble of RCMs better represents high-elevation surface heating and in turn increased convective instability. As a result, the summertime convective precipitation response was opposite to that simulated by the driving global models. Similarly, Walton et al. showed that a kilometre-scale RCM enables a more realistic representation of the snow-albedo feedback in mountainous terrain compared to standard resolution global models, leading to a more plausible simulation of elevation-dependent warming. Bukovsky et al. argue that strong seasonal changes in warm-season precipitation in the Southern Great Plains of the US, projected by RCMs, are more credible than the weaker global model changes because precipitation is better simulated in the RCMs."}

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. Adapted from Giorgi et al.. Including additional components, feedbacks and drivers can substantially modify the simulated future climate. For example, Kjellstrom et al. and Somot et al. have shown that a regional ESM can significantly modify the SST response to climate change of its driving global model with implications for the climate change signal over both the sea and land. In particular, coupled ocean-atmosphere RCMs may increase the credibility of projections in regions of strong air-sea coupling such as the East Asia-western North Pacific domain. Recent studies demonstrate the importance of including regional patterns of evolving aerosols in RCMs for simulating regional climate change. RCMs not including the plant physiological response to increasing CO2 concentrations have been shown to substantially underestimate projected increases in extreme temperatures across Europe compared to GCMs that explicitly model this effect. A difference between the climate changes simulated by two models does not automatically imply the more complex or higher resolution model is superior. Studies comparing convectionpermitting RCM simulations to simulations of climate models with parameterized convection find, depending on the considered models, regions and seasons, either similar or qualitatively different projected changes in short duration extreme precipitation. Process studies provide evidence that convection-permitting simulations better represent crucial local and mesoscale features of convective storms and thus simulate more plausible changes, but further research is required to confirm and reconcile the different findings. Studies assessing the fitness of statistical approaches for regional climate projections are still very limited in number. For statistical downscaling, a key issue is to include predictors that control long-term changes in regional climate. Models differing only in the choice of predictors may perform similarly in the present climate, but may project opposite precipitation changes. In addition to trend-evaluation studies, perfect-model experiments have been used to assess whether a given model structure with a chosen set of predictors is capable of reproducing the simulated future climates. Importantly, it is found that standard analogue methods inherently underestimate future warming trends because of missing analogues for a warmer climate. Bias adjustment assumes that model biases are time invariant, such that the adjustment made to present climate simulations is still applicable to future climate simulations. Many findings challenge the validity of this assumption, as already assessed in AR5. Further research has addressed this issue by means of perfect model experiments and process understanding. Perfect-model studies with GCMs found that circulation, energy, and water-cycle biases are roughly state-independent, whereas temperature biases depend linearly on temperature. Others show that regional temperature biases may depend on soil moisture and albedo, and may thus be state-dependent. The fitness of weather generators for future projections depends on whether they account for all relevant changes in their parameters, either by predictors or change factors."}

Overall, there is high confidence that an assessment of model fitness for projections applying process-based evaluation, process-based plausibility checks of projections and a comparison of different model types, increases the confidence in climate projections. There is high confidence that increasing model resolution, dynamical downscaling, statistical downscaling with well simulated predictors controlling regional climate change, and adding relevant model components can increase the fitness for projecting some aspects of regional climate when accompanied by a process-understanding analysis. 10.3.3.10 Synthesis of model performance at simulating regional climate and climate change Global models reproduce many of the features of observed climate and its variability at regional scales. However, global models can show a variety of biases in, for instance, precipitation and temperature at scales ranging from continental to sub-continental scales, both in the mean and in higher order moments of the climatological distribution of the variable. Regional biases could occur even if all the relevant large-scale processes are correctly represented, but not their interaction with regional features such as orography or land-sea contrasts. These biases have been considered an important limiting factor in model usability, especially at the regional scale. In spite of this, global model simulations have been extensively used to create regional estimates of climate change, taking into account the result of a performance assessment. However, their application is limited in part by the effective resolution of these models. Global model performance at the regional scale is assessed in terms of the time or spatial averages of key variables, the ability to reproduce their seasonal cycle or a set of extreme climate indicators and the representation of regional processes and phenomena, feedbacks, drivers and forcing impacts. In many cases, the performance estimates have been used to select models for either an application or a more in-depth study, to select the models that provide boundary conditions to perform RCM simulations or to weight the results of the GCM simulations. While some large-scale metrics are improved between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 experiments, there is not yet concluding evidence of a systematic improvement for surface variables at the regional scale. The special class of high-resolution global models is expected to improve some of the regional processes that are not appropriately represented in standard global models. There is general consensus that increasing global model resolution improves some long-standing biases, although the resolution increase is not a guarantee of overall improvement. For instance, increasing resolution in global models has been shown to improve Asian monsoon rainfall anchored to orography and the monsoon circulation, but fails to solve the major dry bias. It is also difficult to disentangle the role of resolution increase and model tuning on the performance of the GCM. Some efforts have been undertaken to complement the performance improvements of resolution by using stochastic parameterisations, which explicitly acknowledge the multi-scale nature of the climate system, in standard resolution global models with some success. The expectation is to achieve a similar performance to the increase in resolution at a reduced computational cost. Despite their known errors that affect model performance, there is high confidence that global models provide useful information for the production of regional climate information. There is robust evidence and"}

There is robust evidence that stochastic parameterisations can help to improve some aspects of the global model performance that are relevant to regional climate information. Global models tend to have difficulties in simulating climate over regions where unresolved local scale processes, feedbacks and nonlinear scale interactions result in a degradation of the model performance compared to models with higher resolution. In this case, RCMs and variable resolution global models can resolve part of these processes in the regions of interest at an acceptable computational cost. The assessment of RCM performance needs to focus not only on mean climatology, but also trends and extremes, and the RCMs ability at correctly reproducing relevant processes, forcings and feedbacks to be fit for future projections. When RCMs are driven by global models, part of the uncertainty in the RCM simulation is introduced by the global model biases. As RCMs are typically not able to mitigate global model biases in large-scale dynamical processes, if such biases are substantial, and if the corresponding large-scale processes are important drivers of regional climate, downscaling is questionable. However, when global models have weak circulation biases and regional climate change is controlled mainly by regional-scale processes and feedbacks, dynamical downscaling has the potential to add substantial value to global model simulations. There is very high confidence that RCMs add value to global simulations in representing many regional weather and climate phenomena, especially over regions of complex orography or with heterogeneous surface characteristics and for local-scale phenomena. Realistically representing local-scale phenomena such as land-sea breezes requires simulations at a resolution of the order of 10 km. Simulations at kilometre-scale resolution add value in particular to the representation of convection, sub-daily summer precipitation extremes and soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks. Resolving regional processes may be required to correctly represent the sign of regional climate change. However, the performance of RCMs and their fitness for future projections depend on their representation of relevant processes, forcings and drivers in the specific context. Statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators outperform uncorrected output of global and regional models for a range of statistical aspects at single locations due to their calibration, but RCMs are superior when spatial fields are relevant. Similarly, there is some evidence that bias adjustment is comparable in performance when applied to global models and dynamically downscaled global models only for single locations, but dynamical downscaling prior to bias adjustment clearly adds value once spatial dependence is relevant. These results may explain why dynamical downscaling does not add value to global model simulations for agricultural modelling, when both global and regional model are bias adjusted, but dynamical downscaling adds value compared to bias adjusted global model output for spatially distributed hydrological models. Overall, statistical downscaling methods with carefully chosen predictors and an appropriate model structure for a given application realistically represent many statistical aspects of present-day daily temperature and precipitation. Bias adjustment has proven beneficial as an interface between climate model projections and impact modelling in many different contexts. Weather generators realistically simulate many statistical aspects of present-day daily temperature and precipitation. The performance of these approaches and"}

In a regional downscaling context, uncertainties arise in every step of the modelling chain. Here the propagation of uncertainties, the management of uncertainties, the role of the internal variability for regional projections, and the design and use of ensembles to account for uncertainties will be assessed. Observational uncertainty, in particular for the calibration of statistical downscaling methods, also contributes to projection uncertainty. 10.3.4.1 Propagation of uncertainties Modelling chains for generating regional climate information range from the definition of forcing scenarios to the global modelling, and potentially to dynamical or statistical downscaling and bias adjustment. The propagation and potential accumulation of uncertainties along the chain has been termed the cascade of uncertainty. Even within one model, like a global model, uncertainty propagates across scales. From a process point of view, these uncertainties are related to forcings and global climate sensitivity, and errors in the representation of the large-scale circulation and regional processes, feedbacks and drivers. From a modelling point of view, these uncertainties are related to the choice of dynamical and statistical models and experimental design. The overall uncertainty can be statistically decomposed into the individual sources, although there might be nonlinear dependencies between them. Uncertainty propagation often increases the spread in regional climate projections when comparing global model and downscaled results, which has been used as an argument against top-down approaches to climate information. Increased spread in the modelling chain may also arise from a more comprehensive representation of previously unknown or underrepresented uncertainties. The increased spread in this case goes together with a better representation of processes and thus an increased model fitness for purpose. 10.3.4.2 Representing and reducing uncertainties Climate response uncertainties can be represented by multi-model ensembles, although the sampled uncertainty typically underestimates the full range of uncertainty. Traditionally, climate response uncertainty has been characterized by the ensemble spread around the multi-model mean change. The change has then further been qualified in terms of the agreement across models and compared to estimates of internal climate variability. Since AR5, several limitations of this approach have been identified such as the failure to address physically plausible, but low probability high-impact scenarios or that qualitatively different or even opposite changes may be equally plausible at the regional scale. In a multi-model mean these different responses would be lumped together, strongly dampened, and qualified as non-robust, whereas in fact high impacts might occur. Further, the multi-model mean itself is often implausible because it is a statistical construct. Overall, there is high confidence that some regional future climate changes are not well characterised by multi-model mean and spread. Since AR5, physical climate storyline approaches (see also Chapter 1, Box 10.2, Section 10.5.3, and Atlas"}

In addition to providing information on internal variability, ensembles of simulations can estimate scenario uncertainty and model uncertainty. Chapter 4, especially Box 4.1, discusses issues involved with evaluating ensembles of GCM simulations and their uncertainties. In a downscaling context, further considerations are necessary, such as the selection of GCM-RCM combinations when performing dynamical downscaling. This is a relevant issue when resources are limited. The structural uncertainty of both the GCM and the downscaling method can be important, as well as further potential uncertainty created by inconsistencies between the GCM and the downscaling method, which could include, for example, differences in topography or the way to model precipitation processes. An important consideration is which set of GCMs should be used for GCM-RCM combinations. If adequate resources exist, then large numbers of GCM-RCM combinations are possible. However, coordinated downscaling programmes can be limited by the human and computational resources available, for producing ensembles of downscaled output, which limits the number of feasible GCM-RCM combinations. With this limitation in mind, a small set of GCMs may be chosen that span the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity in available GCMs, though this range may be inconsistent with the likely range, or some other relevant measure of sensitivity, such as the projected range of tropical SSTs. A further choice is to emphasize models that do not have the same origins or that do not use similar parameterizations and thus might be viewed as independent, a criterion that could be applied to both GCMs and RCMs. GCMs and RCMs could also be discarded that unrealistically represent processes controlling the regional climate of interest. Box 4.1 offers a more detailed discussion of the issues surrounding these approaches. Finally, GCMs may be selected to represent different physically selfconsistent changes in regional climate. Statistical methods can provide estimates of outcomes from missing GCM-RCM combinations in a large matrix. However, even using a relatively small set of GCMs can still involve substantial computation that strains available resources, both for performing the simulations and for using all simulations in the ensemble for further impacts assessment. The NARCCAP programme used only a subset of its possible GCM-RCM combinations that balanced comprehensiveness of sampling the matrix with economy of computation demand, while still allowing discrimination, via ANOVA methods, of GCM and RCM influences on regional climate change. An advantage of the sparse, but balanced matrix for those using the downscaling output for further studies, is that they have a smaller, yet comprehensive set of GCM-RCM combinations to work with. Alternatively, data-clustering methods can clump together downscaling simulations featuring similar climate-change characteristics, so that only one representative simulation from each cluster may be needed for further impacts analysis, again systematically reducing the necessary number of simulations to work with. Independently of the resources, participation of multiple models in a simulation programme such as CORDEX for RCMs or CMIP for GCMs creates ensembles of opportunity, which are ensembles populated by models that participants chose to use without there necessarily being an overarching guiding principle for an optimum choice. As discussed in Chapter 4, these ensembles are likely suboptimal for assessing sources of uncertainty. An important contributor to the suboptimal character of such an ensemble is that the models are not independent. Some may also have larger biases than others. Yet often, the output from models in these ensembles has received equal weight when viewed collectively, as was the case in much of the AR5"}

Cross-Chapter Box 10.2: Relevance and limitations of bias adjustment Coordinators: Alessandro Dosio, Douglas Maraun Contributors: Ana Casanueva, Jose M. Gutierrez, Stefan Lange, Jana Sillmann Bias adjustment is an approach to post-process climate model output and has become widely used in climate hazard and impact studies and national assessment reports. Despite its wide use, bias adjustment was not assessed in AR5. Several problems have been identified that may arise from an uncritical use of bias adjustment, and that may result in misleading impact assessments. The rationale of this Cross-Chapter Box is to provide an overview of the use of bias adjustment in this report, and to assess key limitations of the approach. Bias-adjusted climate model output is used extensively throughout this report. Several results from Chapter 8, and many of the climatic impact-drivers in Chapter 12 are based on bias adjustment. The Atlas presents many results both as raw and bias-adjusted data. The application of bias adjustment in the WGI1 report was informed by the assessment in Chapter 10 and this Cross-Chapter Box. Finally, bias adjustment is crucial for many studies assessed in the WG II report. An overview of bias adjustment can be found in Section 10.3.1.3, a general performance assessment of individual method classes in Section 10.3.3.7. The fitness of bias adjustment for climate change applications is assessed in Section 10.3.3.9. Relevance of bias adjustment An argument made for the use of bias adjustment is the fact that impact models are commonly very sensitive, often nonlinearly, to the input climatic variables and their biases, in particular when threshold-based climate indices are required. There are, however, cases where bias adjustment may not be necessary or useful, such as: when only qualitative statements are required; when only changes in mean climate are considered; when percentile-based indices are used. Modification of the climate change signal Bias adjustment methods like quantile mapping can modify simulated climate trends, with impacts on changes to climate indices, in particular, extremes. Some argue that these trend modifications are implicit corrections of state-dependent biases. However, others argue that the modification is generally invalid because the modification is linked to the representation of day-to-day rather than long-term variability; a given temperature value does not necessarily belong to the same weather state in present and future climate; the modification affects the models climate sensitivity; and is affected by random internal climate variability. Thus, trend preserving quantile mapping methods have been developed, although some authors found no clear advantage of these methods. Further research is required to fully understand the validity of trend modifications by quantile-mapping."}

As bias adjustment in general does not account for circulation errors, it is therefore important to understand the impact of these errors on the outcome of the bias adjustment. If the frequency of precipitation-relevant weather types is biased, a standard bias adjustment would remove the overall climatological bias, but the precipitation falling in a given weather type could still be substantially biased. Adjusting the number of wet days can artificially deteriorate the spell-length distribution. In the presence of location biases of circulation patterns, bias adjustment may introduce physically implausible solutions. Bias adjusting the location of circulation features may introduce inconsistencies with the model orography, land-sea contrasts, and SSTs. There is medium confidence that the selection of climate models with low biases in the frequency, persistence and location of large-scale atmospheric circulation can reduce negative impacts of bias adjustment. Using bias adjustment for statistical downscaling Bias adjustment is often used to downscale climate model results from grid box data to finer resolution or point scale. It is sometimes even directly applied to coarse-resolution global model output to avoid an intermediate dynamical downscaling step. But bias adjustment does not add any information about the processes acting on un-resolved scales and is therefore by construction not capable of bridging substantial scale gaps. Using bias adjustment for downscaling has been shown to artificially modify long-term trends, misrepresent the spatial characteristics of extreme events, and misrepresent local weather phenomena such as temperature inversions. Crucially, sub-grid influences on the local climate change signal are not represented. For instance, if a mountain chain is not resolved in the driving model, the snow-albedo feedback is not represented by the bias adjustment such that local temperature trends in high altitudes are under-represented. It has therefore been suggested to account for local random variability by combining bias adjustment with stochastic downscaling, although this approach still does not account for local modifications of the climate change signal. Two approaches have been proposed to represent these local changes: dynamical downscaling with high-resolution RCMs or statistical emulators of such. Sections 10.3.3.410.3.3.6 and 10.3.3.9 discuss other examples where RCMs improve the representation of regional phenomena and regional climate change. Overall, there is high confidence that the use of bias adjustment for statistical downscaling, in particular to downscale coarse resolution global models, has severe limitations.

In several situations, for example, if the dependence between the variables is not well simulated, univariate bias adjustment of the individual variables may increase biases in the resulting indicator. A simple alternative would be a bias adjustment of the indicator, but such a procedure may substantially alter the climate change signal, in particular for extreme events. Multivariate bias adjustment methods are in principle good to adjust all statistical aspects of the multivariate distribution that they intend to adjust. Depending on the method, this includes the correlation structure or even broader aspects of the dependence. If multivariate adjustment includes a spatial dimension, then spatial dependence is adjusted well, but care is needed when applied across large areas. Adjustment of multivariate dependence necessarily modifies the temporal sequencing of the driving model. The extent of the modification depends on the chosen method and the number of variables to adjust. Bias adjustment in the presence of observational uncertainty and internal variability Observational uncertainties and internal variability introduce uncertainty in the estimation of biases and thus in the calibration of bias-adjustment methods. Dobor and Hlasny found a considerable influence of the choice of the observational dataset and calibration period on the adjustment for some regions. RCM biases are typically larger than observational uncertainties, but in some regions, and in particular for wet-day frequencies, spatial patterns and the intensity distribution of daily precipitation, the situation may reverse. Switanek et al. found a strong influence of internal variability and thus of the choice of calibration period on the calibration of quantile mapping and on the modification of the climate change signal. Bias adjustment is typically evaluated using cross-validation, i.e. by calibrating the adjustment function to one period of the observational record, and by evaluating it on a different one. Maraun et al. and Maraun and Widmann demonstrated that, in the presence of multi-decadal internal variability, crossvalidation may lead to a rejection of a valid bias adjustment or even lead to a positive evaluation of an invalid adjustment. The authors therefore argued that, in the presence of substantial internal variability, the evaluation of bias adjustment requires to consider aspects that have not been adjusted, such as temporal, spatial, or multi-variable dependence. There is high confidence that observational uncertainty and internal variability adversely affect bias adjustment and introduce uncertainties in bias adjusted future projections. Overall assessment and new avenues In the light of these issues, several authors dismiss the use of bias adjustment for climate change studies. Ehret et al. and Stocker et al. propose to at least provide the raw model output alongside the adjusted data. Maraun et al. argue that the target resolution should be similar to the model resolution to avoid downscaling issues. Stocker et al. and Maraun et al. highlighted the relevance of understanding model biases and the misrepresentations of the underlying physical processes prior to any adjustment. Together with Galmarini et al. , they point out the need for collaboration between bias adjustment users, experts in climate modelling and experts in the considered regional climate. As new research avenues, development of process-oriented bias adjustment methods or run-time bias adjustment integrated into the climate simulation, e.g., to reduce circulation errors are proposed."}

Temperature detection results are found to be robust to the use of different observational data sets and detection methodologies. Detection of mean precipitation changes caused by human influence is much more difficult, due to a larger role of internal variability at regional to local scales, as well as substantial modelling and observational uncertainty. However, multi-decadal precipitation changes due to anthropogenic forcing have been detected for several regions. Ma et al. show that anthropogenic forcing has strongly contributed to the observed shift of China daily precipitation towards heavy precipitation. The observed weakening of the East Asia summer monsoon, also known as the southern flooding and northern drought pattern has been partially linked to anthropogenic forcing. Changes in GHGs lead to increasing precipitation over southern China, whilst changes in anthropogenic aerosols over East Asia are the dominant factors determining drought conditions over northern China. Based on allforcing and single-forcing simulation ensembles with a high-resolution model, Delworth and Zeng found that the observed long-term regional austral autumn and winter rainfall decline over southern and particularly southwest Australia is partially reproduced in response to anthropogenic changes in GHGs and ozone in the atmosphere, whereas anthropogenic aerosols do not contribute to the simulated precipitation decline. In contrast, the observed increase of northwest Australian summertime rainfall since 1950 has been partially attributed to anthropogenic aerosol based on CMIP5 detection and attribution single-forcing simulations. It is noteworthy that these methods require a very significant reduction of spatial and temporal dimensions in order to reliably estimate the covariance matrix of internal variability. Finally, model bias is rarely considered in statistical models used in detection and attribution regional studies, while it has been shown to have a strong impact on the stability of detection results and their associated confidence intervals when increasing the spatial dimension. New statistical methods are emerging to provide some alternative to standard optimal fingerprinting but they have not yet been evaluated and applied at regional scales. 10.4.1.2 Other spatiotemporal statistical methods for isolating regional climate responses to external forcing The primary objective of any attribution method is to optimally separate the influences of external forcing and internal variability on a global or regional climate record. In a multi-model ensemble context, the estimation of the externally-forced climate response has been typically performed by ensemble averaging of linear trends or regional domain spatial average, thus not taking into account the available and complete space and time covariance information. Since AR5, methods using spatiotemporal information have been further developed and used to improve the separation between external and internal drivers in multiple or single historical climate realizations performed by a given global model. The typical ensemble size of CMIP historical climate simulations for a given model traditionally ranges between one and ten members, with three often being the default choice. At the regional scale, a simple ensemble average with such sample sizes does not provide robust estimates of the response patterns to external forcing. Since AR5, pattern filtering methods such as signalto-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal functions have been shown to improve the identification of forced response patterns when only few model members are available. Using SMILEs as a test bed, it has been shown that pattern filtering strongly reduces the number of ensemble members needed to estimate the forced response pattern compared to simple ensemble averaging. Pattern filtering allows the identification of low signal-to-noise signals such as the El Nino-like response to volcanic eruptions."}

Dynamical adjustment seeks to isolate changes in surface air temperature or precipitation that are due purely to atmospheric circulation changes. The residual can then be analysed and attributed to internal changes in both land or ocean surface conditions and the thermodynamical response to external forcing. Smoliak et al. performed their dynamical adjustment using partial least squares regression of temperature to remove variations arising from sea-level pressure changes. Deser et al. used constructed atmospheric circulation analogues and resampling to estimate the dynamical contribution to changes in temperature. Sippel et al. used machine learning techniques known as regularized linear regression to provide estimates of circulation-induced components of precipitation and temperature variability from global to local scales. It is noteworthy that the dynamical adjustment method by itself cannot account for the component of the forced response associated with circulation changes that project onto atmospheric internal variability. However, this component can be estimated within a model framework by averaging the dynamical contribution across multiple members of a SMILE. Dynamical adjustment methods have been used by, for instance, Deser et al., Saffioti et al., OReilly et al., Gong et al., and Guo et al.. Deser et al. focused on the causes of observed and simulated multi-decadal trends in North American temperature. They demonstrated that the main advantage of this technique is to narrow the spread of temperature trends found by the model ensemble and to bring the dynamically-adjusted observational trend much closer to the forced response estimated by the model ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained by Saffioti et al. regarding recent observed winter temperature and precipitation trends over Europe. Similarly, OReilly et al. applied dynamical adjustment techniques to more carefully determine the influence of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability on continental climates. Over Europe, summer temperature anomalies induced thermodynamically by the warm phase of the AMV are further reinforced by circulation anomalies; meanwhile, precipitation signals are largely controlled by dynamical responses to the AMV. Based on a partial least-squares approach, Gong et al. showed that recent winter temperature 30-year trends over northern East Asia are strongly influenced by internal variability linked to decadal changes of the Arctic Oscillation. Using dynamical adjustment purely on precipitation observations, Guo et al. showed that human influence has led to increased wintertime precipitation across north-eastern North America, as well as a small region of north-western North America, and to an increase in precipitation across much of northwestern and north central Eurasia. The latter results confirm previous findings obtained by standard optimal fingerprinting methods. Time-scale separation methods such as the low-frequency component analysis and ensemble empirical mode decomposition methods take advantage of the longer time scale associated with anthropogenic external forcing compared to that of most internal modes of variability. The low-frequency component analysis method tries to find low-frequency variability patterns by searching for linear combinations of a moderate number of empirical orthogonal functions that maximize the ratio of low-frequency to total variance. It has first been used to separate internal modes of interannual and decadal variability from slowly varying and externally-forced variability in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The methodology has also been applied to patterns of observed surface air temperature to isolate the slow components of observed changes that are consistent with the expected response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition method decomposes data, such as time series of historical temperature and precipitation, into independent oscillatory modes of decreasing frequency. The last step of the method leaves behind a smooth and low-frequency residual time series. Typically, the nonlinear anthropogenic trend can be reconstructed by summing the long-term mean, the residual, and eventually the lowest-frequency mode to account for a multi-decadal forced signal, for instance associated with anthropogenic aerosol forcing. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition method is an example of a datadriven, non-parametric approach that can be used to directly provide an estimate of the forced response"}

The trends arising from simulations constrained by natural forcing-only and all-forcing are compared with distributions of trends purely due to internal variability and derived from long simulations with constant pre-industrial external forcing. Consistency between observed and simulated historical trends is also assessed with statistical tests that can be applied independently over a large number of grid points. The fraction of area over a given region where the change is classified as detectable, attributable, or consistent/inconsistent, is then finally estimated. The method can be viewed as a simple consistency test for both amplitude and pattern of observed versus simulated trends. Its application to CMIP3 and CMIP5 models suggests that 80% of the Earths surface has a detectable anthropogenic warming signal. Regarding regional land precipitation changes over the 19012010 and 195116 2010 periods, application of the univariate detection method based on CMIP5 models suggests attributable anthropogenic changes at several locations such as increases over regions of the north-central United States, southern Canada, Europe, and southern South America and decreases over parts of the Mediterranean region, northern tropical Africa and southwestern Australia. Another regional attribution technique is based on the similarity of past changes between observations and one or several simulations of a large ensemble that share the same time evolution for a suggested driver of these changes. Huang et al. used a perturbed physics ensemble to attribute the drying trend of the Indian monsoon over the latter half of the 20th century to decadal forcing from the Pacific Decadal Variability. The ensemble members predicted different trends in PDV behaviour across the 20th century and the negative precipitation trend was only replicated in those members with a strong negative-to-positive PDV transition across the 1970s, consistent with the observed PDV behaviour. In a similar manner, Cvijanovic et al. addressed the possible influence of Arctic sea-ice loss on the North Pacific pressure ridge and, consequently, on southwestern United States precipitation. They sampled the uncertainties in selected sea-ice physics parameters to achieve a low Arctic sea-ice state in their perturbed simulations. They then compared the latter with control simulations representative of sea-ice conditions at the end of the 20th century to assess changes purely due to sea-ice loss. New methods aiming to remove underlying model biases before performing detection and attribution, for instance related to precipitation changes, are emerging based on image transformation techniques such as warping. By correcting location and seasonal precipitation biases in CMIP5 models, Levy et al. showed that the agreement between observed and fingerprint patterns can be improved, further enhancing the ability to attribute observed precipitation changes to external forcings. The improvement mainly relies on the assumption that precipitation changes are tied to the underlying climatology, which has been shown to be a reasonable assumption in regions of the world where intensification of the hydrological cycle is expected. Importantly, evidence that the models employed in regional-scale attribution are fit for purpose is essential in order to estimate the degree of confidence in the attribution results. For example, models need to be evaluated and assessed in their ability to simulate internal variability modes that are known to be important drivers of regional climate change. Models are likely to have different performance in different regions and therefore their evaluation needs to be performed in terms of key physical processes and mechanisms relevant to the climate of the region under consideration. To conclude, there is very high confidence that the use of diverse and independent attribution methods, multiple model ensemble types and observed datasets strengthens the robustness of results of regional-scale attribution studies.

These examples illustrate attribution statements that are based upon multiple lines of evidence, combining multiple observational data sets, different generations and types of models, process understanding and assessment of various sources of uncertainty. Detection and attribution assessments for all AR6 regions and specific variables can be found in the Atlas. 10.4.2.1 The Sahel and West African monsoon drought and recovery The Sahel, fed by the West African monsoon, has experienced severe decadal rainfall variations. Abundant rainfall in the 1950s1960s was followed by a large negative trend until at least the 1980s, over which annual rainfall fell by 2030%. The subsequent partial recovery is more uncertain: rain-gauge studies suggest a return to long-term positive anomalies in the western Sahel in the early 2000s, while CHIRPS merged satellite/gauge data show a wetter western Sahel since 1981. The recovery has been more significant over the central rather than the western Sahel and a multiple-gauge record supports a greater recovery to the eastern side. In this attribution example, drivers of the long-term drought and subsequent partial recovery are discussed, including anthropogenic GHG and aerosol emissions, and sea surface temperature variations that, in part, relate to internal variability. The reader is also referred to assessment in Section 8.3.2.4. We define the Sahel within 10N20N across to 30E, consistent with the eastern boundary used in Chapter 8, and the rainy season as spanning June to September.

The SST influence has been formalised in an AMV framework, suggesting that relative North Atlantic SST warming increases the Northern Hemisphere differential warming, enhancing Sahel rainfall. The AMV influence is supported by CMIP5 initialized decadal hindcasts, which outperform empirical predictions based on persistence. Some caution is needed since the full magnitude of internal variability is not captured in most CMIP5 models, as poor resolution prevents reproduction of AMV teleconnection responses, and the magnitude of AMV-related SST variation may be underestimated in CMIP5. The influence of PDV has been studied to a lesser extent, with the PDV positive phase having a negative impact on Sahel rainfall in combined observational/CMIP5 analysis. The closer match between the observed rainfall declining trend and those in an atmosphere-only SMILE, in which SSTs are matched to observations, compared to three coupled SMILEs in which they are not, suggests that the underlying ocean surface might be essential in driving the decline. In terms of anthropogenic emissions, regional aerosol emissions from Europe, and to a lesser extent from Asia, have been shown in a global model to weaken Sahel precipitation either through a weakened Saharan heat low or via the Walker circulation. Greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosol can be considered together to control ITCZ position based on temperature asymmetry at the hemispheric scale. GHGs increase Sahel precipitation, while aerosol reduces it. This effect is stronger when models account for aerosol-cloud interactions. Perturbed physics GCM ensembles suggests that aerosol emissions were the main driver of observed drying over 19501980, supported by CMIP5 single-forcing experiments. A coherent drying signal in CMIP5 over the extended 19012010 period has also been found, although smaller than the observed trend. By applying aerosol scaling factors to the historical period in order to sample the uncertainty in CMIP5 aerosol radiative forcing, Shonk et al. found differences of 0.5 mm day-1 for Gulf of Guinea rainfall between strong and weak aerosol experiments as illustrated in Figure 10.11c, although the drying appears further south than observed due to model bias. For the partial recovery in West African monsoon and Sahel rainfall since the late 1980s, a detection study using three reanalyses shows a connection to increasing Saharan temperatures at a rate 24 times greater than the tropical mean, also confirmed by multiple observational and satellite-based data and the review of Cook and Vizy. Reanalyses are also noted to significantly underestimate the Saharan warming. Saharan warming causes a stronger thermal low and more intense monsoon flow, providing more moisture to the central and eastern Sahel, supported by CMIP5 models, although not all models capture the observed rainfall/heat low relationship. Sahel rainfall is also incorrectly located in prototype versions of a few CMIP6 models, related to tropospheric temperature biases. Amplified Saharan warming has increased the wind shear, leading to a tripling of extreme storms since 1982, which may partially explain the recovery. Instead, observations, multiple models and SSTsensitivity experiments with atmospheric GCMs have suggested that stronger Mediterranean Sea evaporation enhances low-level moisture convergence to the Sahel, increasing rainfall. Meanwhile, an atmospheric GCM study suggested that GHGs alone could cause Sahel rainfall recovery, with an additional role for anthropogenic aerosol; recent changes in North Atlantic SSTs, although substantial, did not exert a significant impact on the recovery. Large spread in the recovery in a five-member atmospheric GCM ensemble suggests that atmospheric internal variability cannot be discounted. Consistent timing of the southward ITCZ shift during the decline period in CMIP3 and CMIP5 historical simulations supports the role of external forcing, chiefly anthropogenic aerosol. The evolution of the observed decline and recovery is largely followed by the CMIP5 multi-model mean, further supporting the role of external drivers. Updated results from CMIP6 for historical simulations with all and single forcings are represented in Figure 10.11d,e, showing smaller trends"}

The signal to noise ratio, estimated as the ratio of the forced response to the spread due to internal variability, is also slightly higher for the best-performing models, suggesting that selecting the best-performing models may have an influence on both attribution of the observed trend and emergence of the forced response in future. There is high confidence that southeastern South America summer precipitation has increased since the beginning of the 20th century. Since AR5, science has advanced in the identification of the drivers of the precipitation increase in southeastern South America since 1950, including GHG through various mechanisms, stratospheric ozone depletion and Pacific and Atlantic variability. There is high confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to the southeastern South America summer precipitation increase since 1950, but very low confidence on the relative contribution of each driver to the precipitation increase. 10.4.2.3 The southwestern North America drought Persistent hydroclimatic drought in southwestern North America remains a much-studied event. Drought is a regular feature of the southwestern North Americas climate regime, as can be seen in both the modern record, and through paleoclimate reconstructions, as well as in future climate model projections. Since the early 1980s, which were relatively wet in terms of precipitation and streamflow, the region has experienced major multiyear droughts such as the turn-of-the-century drought that lasted from 1999 to 2005, and the most recent and extreme 20122014 drought that in certain locations is perhaps unprecedented in the last millennium. Shorter dry spells also happened between these multiyear droughts making 1980 to present a period with an exceptionally steep trend from wet to dry, leading to strong declines in Rio Grande and Colorado river flows. While robust attribution of this trend is complicated by the large natural variability in this region, the 20th century warming has been suggested to increase the chances for hydrological drought periods by lowering runoff efficiency and affecting evapotranspiration. There is some evidence suggesting that the Last Glacial Maximum, a period of low atmospheric CO2, ~21 ka ago, has a thermodynamically-driven zonal mean precipitation response similar to that of the current state with relatively high CO2 levels when compared with the pre-industrial period. Pluvial conditions at that time and a reduction in precipitation from the Last Glacial Maximum to the pre-industrial period are consistent with drying trends for the region in models with GHG concentrations exceeding pre-industrial levels. However, the dominant large-scale drivers responsible for the precipitation changes observed during these two transitions are markedly different: mainly ice sheet retreat and increasing insolation on one hand, increasing GHGs on the other hand. This suggests that the Last Glacial Maximum correspondence is fortuitous which strongly limits its use to capture future hydrological cycle changes. Furthermore, the conclusion of the Last Glacial Maximum drying versus wetting seems to strongly depend on the physical property of interest, hydrologic or vegetation indicators. Droughts are characterized by deficits in total soil moisture content that can be caused by a combination of decreasing precipitation and warming temperature, which promotes greater evapotranspiration. Regional-scale attribution of the prevalence of southwestern North America drought since 1980 then mostly focuses on the attribution of change in these two variables. The observed southwestern North America drying fits the narrative of what might happen in response to increasing GHG concentrations due to a poleward expansion of the subtropics, that is conducive to drying trends over subtropical to mid-latitude regions. However, several studies based on modern reanalyses and CMIP5 models have recently shown that the current contribution of GHGs to Northern Hemisphere tropical expansion is much smaller than in the Southern Hemisphere and will remain difficult to detect due to large internal variability, even by the end of the 21st century (Section 3.3.3.1; Garfinkel et al., 2015; Allen and Kovilakam, 2017; Grise et al., 2018,"}

This section assesses a few methodological aspects related to robustness and emergence properties of the regional-scale forced response as well as the possible influence of internal variability on the emergence of the anthropogenic signal. 10.4.3.1 Robustness of the anthropogenic signal at regional scale Standard methodologies to derive the regional forced response include pattern scaling and the time-shift or epoch approach. Pattern scaling assumes that the spatial patterns of regional change, often based on a time-averaged 20 or 30-year period at the end of the 21st century, are roughly constant in time, and simply scale linearly with global mean warming. The time-shift approach defines a target in terms of global warming level and locates the time segment, usually 20 or 30 years, in historical or scenario simulations in which global mean warming matches the required GWL. Physical consistency between multiple variables and space-time covariance are fully preserved in the time-shift approach, which is not the case for pattern-scaling. Importantly, pattern scaling cannot account for the non-linearity arising from either interacting quasi-linear processes and purely nonlinear mechanisms, which have been shown to be present in CMIP5 models for high GWL and affect precipitation more than temperature at the regional-scale. The time-shift approach can also be used to test whether regional climate change patterns depend on the rate of global mean warming and external forcing pathways, in addition to global warming magnitude. A global evaluation of both approaches in projecting the forced temperature and precipitation response for a highly mitigated scenario based on a moderately mitigated one has been performed using a perfect-model framework. The amplitude of errors for both approaches appears to be substantially smaller than model uncertainty approximated by the CMIP5 multi-model spread. Based on large and coordinated modelling exercises such as CMIP5 and CORDEX, the time-shift approach has been largely used to assess differences in regional climate impacts for different GWLs, with a strong focus on 1.5C versus 2C. Comparisons between pattern scaling and time-shift approaches allow assessment of the scalability of the regional climate change signal and the extent to which pattern scaling assumptions still hold at regional scale for a wide range of GWL. This was the approach followed by Matte et al. in their assessment of the scalability of European regional climate projections. Based on EURO-CORDEX projections, they performed a detailed comparison between the pattern scaling and the GWL spatial patterns for different seasons, regional model resolutions, and both temperature and precipitation. High pattern correlation values are found between the scaled pattern and all GWL patterns for temperature. In the case of precipitation, the correspondence is slightly lower, especially in summer, for high GWLs and much lower for 1C. Figure 10.14 illustrates a similar comparison based on the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble forced with the scenario SSP5-8.5 and applied to two large-scale continental areas. The forced response to anthropogenic forcing is simply taken as the CMIP6 multi-model mean of future regional climate change relative to the 18501900 reference period. Robustness of the forced response is based on both significance of the change and model agreement about the sign of change. Caution has to be exercised against a too literal interpretation of lack of robust change given that significance and sign agreement can be sensitive to spatial and temporal aggregation and lack of a robust change does not necessarily translate to lack of regional-scale climate change impacts."}

The crisis initially polarized society, with conflict emerging between various water users and erosion of trust in the government, but eventually social cohesion and an acute awareness of limited water resources emerged. Cape Towns crisis resulted from a combination of a strong, rare multi-year meteorological drought, estimated at 1 in 300 years, and factors related to the nature of the water supply system, operational water management and water resource policies. Cape Town was very successful in implementing water-saving actions after the previous drought of 20002003, reducing water losses from over 22% to 15%, breaking the previous coupling of growth in water demand with growth in population. As a consequence, Cape Town won a Water Smart City award from the C40 Cities program only three years prior to the crisis. However, the water-saving actions, together with changing priorities in water resource provision from infrastructure-oriented towards resource and demand management, may well have led to delays in implementation of the expansion of water supply infrastructure. The expansion plan, formulated a decade prior to the crisis, included an expectation of longterm climate-change drying in the region. The crisis also exposed structural deficiencies of water management and inadequacy of a policy process in which decisions about local water resources are taken at a national level, particularly in a situation of political tension. The crisis was widely seen as a harbinger of future problems to be faced by the city, and a highlight of vulnerability of many cities in the world resulting from the interplay of three factors: 1) the fast urban-population growth, 2) the economic, policy, infrastructural and water resource paradigms and constraints, and 3) anthropogenic climate change.

In the longer-term, Cape Town regional rainfall is characterized by a multi-decadal scale quasi-periodicity, with the 20152017 drought and previous strong droughts occurring during the rainfalls periodic low phases. However, the studies linking the Cape Town 20152017 drought to the hemispheric processes expressed by the SAM focused almost exclusively on the post-1979 period, when global reanalyses are available. Detailed understanding of the drivers of previous Cape Town region droughts and the role of hemispheric processes expressed by the SAM in the pre-1979 period is missing. The Cape Town regional rainfall is also potentially linked to other hemispheric phenomena, such as the expansion of the tropics and, specifically, the South Atlantic high-pressure system and the position of the subtropical jet, which share some variability with the SAM. The relationships between these phenomena and Cape Town rainfall have not been thoroughly investigated outside of the context of the 20152017 drought, but the drought itself was associated with poleward expansion of the subtropical anticyclones in the South Atlantic and South Indian Oceans and poleward displacement of the moisture corridor across the South Atlantic, as well as a weaker subtropical jet. Burls et al. also link the decline in the number of rainy days to the increase in sea-level pressure along the poleward flank of the South Atlantic high-pressure system and the intensity of the post-frontal ridging high. Additionally, there is a possible linkage between Cape Town rainfall and near-shore cold sea surface temperature anomalies arising from Ekman upwelling due to reduced westerly and increased southeasterly winds. These might lead to suppression of convection and reduction of rainfall over land. All these phenomena are conceptually consistent with the poleward migration of the westerlies and expansion of the tropics. Rainfall in the Cape Town region also responds to SST anomalies in the Southeast Atlantic, including the Agulhas Current retroflection region, which may drive intensification of low-pressure systems, leading to the trailing front strengthening as it makes landfall over the Cape Town region. There are also linkages at seasonal time scale between the Cape Town regional rainfall and Antarctic sea ice. In addition to mid-latitude controls, subtropical processes also play a role in the Cape Town regions rainfall variability. The 10 30 S region of the subtropical Atlantic, parts of the South American continent and even parts of the African continent north of Cape Town are sources of moisture for atmospheric river events contributing to frontal rainfall, with implications for the 201536 2017 drought. Also, the second major rainfall contributing system, cut-off-lows, is conditional on moisture supply from the sub-tropics. Although El Nino-Southern Oscillation influences climate in southern Africa, any relationship between ENSO and Cape Towns rainfall is weak and inconsistent, showing the strongest impact in May to June. ENSO, however, does influence large-scale processes and phenomena relevant to the drought, though the relationship between ENSO and the SAM is complex, with each ENSO event influencing the SAM differently in different seasons. Similarly, ENSO affects meridional circulation and thus the subtropical anticyclone as well as the polar and subtropical jets, but only modifying, not controlling, their role in Cape Towns rainfall. Paleoclimate studies reveal that long-term variability in the winter rainfall region of South Africa is consistent with a general framework of warming/cooling-induced latitudinal migration of the westerlies and transformation of the subtropical high-pressure belt and associated hemispherical processes. The synchronicity of winter rainfall with Antarctic ice-core-derived polar temperature anomalies is consistently revealed in studies using different paleoclimate proxies and time scales of 1.4k, ~3k and 12k years. Changes in rainfall regimes at shorter time scales appear to reflect influence of local processes such as the Agulhas current's interaction with the Atlantic, resulting in changes"}

However, in general, CMIP5 models capture well the seasonality, such as the dominance of austral winter rains, although they overestimate the peak and underestimate the shoulder season rainfall. Trends in rainfall are particularly difficult to assess as they are generally weak and depend strongly on the time period and dataset adopted for the analyses. A multi-method attribution study estimates the probability of the 20152017 drought to have increased by a factor of 3 since pre-industrial times. However, throughout the 20th century, a substantial portion of the global climate models simulate a statistically significant decline in total annual rainfall, while there is no robust long-term trend in observations. Section 10.4 offers a more detailed assessment of attribution challenges. GCMs capture the overall behaviour of the observed main hemispherical processes, such as the expansion of the tropics, a positive trend in SAM and the poleward shift of the westerly jet. However, they fail to capture details of their observed climatology and variability, and the magnitudes of simulated trends vary, though the models typically underestimate observed trends in these processes. In general, CMIP5 models do capture the SAM-regional rainfall association, although not consistently across all seasons. 10.6.2.6 Future climate information from global simulations GCMs show strong consistency in a drying signal for the Cape Town region, with the reduction in total annual rainfall ranging up to 20% by the end of the 21st century in CMIP5 RCP8.5 and CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 simulations. The consistency across the models is a robust signal compared to the rest of southern Africa, where the climate change signal varies spatially: stronger drying in the west and moderate drying or weak wetting in the east. Rainfall changes projected for the Cape Town region are consistent with projected changes in hemispheric-scale processes and regional-scale dynamics that point toward reduced frequency of frontal systems affecting that region. These changes include robust signals in CMIP5 models for the Southern Hemisphere for a poleward expansion of the tropics, poleward displacement of mid-latitude storm tracks, increased strength and poleward shift of the westerly winds and subtropical jet-streams, and a shift toward a more positive phase of the SAM. However, despite the consistency in circulation changes, the emergence of anthropogenic rainfall change above unforced variability in southwestern Africa remains uncertain for annual rainfall throughout most of the 21st century, even under SSP5-8.5. There is also a substantial increase in the frequency of conditions supporting atmospheric rivers and water vapour transport towards the southwest coast of southern Africa in the projected climate. This behaviour has strong implications for the region, as most topographically high locations receive rainfall from persistent atmospheric rivers. A thorough understanding of the role of atmospheric rivers in the Cape Town region under a changing climate is missing. 10.6.2.7 Future climate information from regional downscaling Dynamical downscaling studies implemented with a stretched-grid model revealed a signal compatible with the driving CMIP5 ensemble, that is, consistent drying throughout the region, amplifying in time, irrespective of the considered emission scenario and the generation of GCMs (DEA,"}

A multi-model CORDEX ensemble indicates a robust signal of reduction of total annual rainfall in the future, although there is less agreement on how changes in rainfall occurrence may evolve in the region, such as through fewer consecutive rain days or longer dry spells. For the end of the century under RCP8.5, Dosio et al. also found drying. Moreover, in their analysis, the drying is associated with an increase in the number of consecutive dry days and a reduction in number of rainy days. Their results are consistent with the driving GCMs for all the precipitation indices, and they are robust independent of the choice of the regional climate model or GCM. However, collectively, these analyses indicate that uncertainty remains in the characteristics of the precipitation decrease. 10.6.2.8 Storyline approaches There is a consistency in rainfall projections with the projections of rainfall drivers and with the general understanding of the influence of global warming on the circulation dynamics and rainfall patterns in the region. Thus, the expansion of the South Atlantic high-pressure system, related to widespread warming of the tropics and poleward shift of the subsiding limb of the Hadley cell, is associated with the southward displacement of the subtropical jet, and southward migration of mid-latitude westerlies and storm tracks, in addition to changes in the SAM. These effects are also relatively consistent with recent declines in rainfall in the Cape Town region. The storyline of an extended drought is thus a set of events that can yield reduced rainfall in the Cape Town region: poleward shift of the downward branch of the Hadley cell that produces a sustained southward shift in mid-latitude westerlies and storm tracks. The behaviour is potentially reinforced by changes in the SAM. 10.6.2.9 Climate information distilled from multiple lines of evidence There is high agreement among observational data and reanalyses that the recent downward trend in the Cape Town regions rainfall leading to the 20152017 drought is related to the hemispheric processes of poleward shift in the westerlies and expansion of the Hadley circulation. However, there is less support for the precipitation-circulation relationship in historical CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations. As a consequence, there is only medium confidence that these process changes produced the 20152017 drought leading to the 2018 water crisis. For the water-resource planner who has to deal with potential drought like the 2015-2017 event, several lines of evidence indicate future drying: the projected precipitation by GCMs and RCMs of different spatial resolutions, and the observed and projected changes of circulation patterns consistent with drier conditions, the paleoclimatic evidence confirming a millennial-scale circulation-rainfall link. However, the distillation is limited by a lack of information about whether or not a relationship between Cape Town precipitation and large-scale circulation processes adequately explains droughts in the twentieth century prior to 1979. Thus, although a clear association appears in observations from 1979 onward between increasing GHG concentrations, drying in the Cape Town region and behaviour of a key circulation process, the SAM, further analysis suggests caution. Not all GCMs show the historical post-1979 association among these factors, and when the observational record is extended back further to times when the anthropogenic greenhouse forcing was weaker, there is no strong association between the SAM and Cape Town drought. Thus, there is only medium confidence in the expectation of a future drier climate for Cape Town. 10.6.3 Indian Summer Monsoon 10.6.3.1 Motivation and regional context The Indian summer monsoon provides 80% of the countrys annual rainfall from June to September, supplying the majority of water for agriculture, industry, drinking and sanitation to over a billion people."}

Evidence from paleoclimate records shows high confidence in a weakened Indian monsoon during cold epochs of the past such as the Younger Dryas as measured by speleothem oxygen isotopes. There is a pressing need to understand if the monsoon will change in the future under anthropogenic forcing and to quantify such changes. Multiple datasets have shown robust negative trends since the 1950s until the turn of the century followed by a recovery, yet repeated assessments project the monsoon to increase in strength under enhanced GHG forcing. The apparent contradiction between future projections and observed historical trends makes the region an ideal choice for an in-depth assessment. The reader is also referred to the South Asia regional assessment of precipitation extremes, which is not discussed here for brevity. 10.6.3.2 The regional climate of India Local geography gives rise to distinct differences in societal experience of the summer monsoon. The southwesterly monsoon winds are incident upon the Western Ghats mountains on the west coast, leading to orographic enhancement and heavy rains, which supply rivers with water for much of the southern peninsula, often the subject of inter-regional water disputes. The northern plains contain the Ganges river and also Indias most intensive agriculture, both rainfed and irrigated. Synoptic systems known as monsoon depressions cross the northern east coast, supplying much of the rain in central India. Further north, the eastern Himalayas are dominated by the summer monsoon, while the western Himalayas receive most rainfall from western disturbances during winter. Meanwhile, southeastern India sits under a rain shadow. 10.6.3.3 Observational issues for India India has one of the oldest rain-gauge networks in the world, leading to the production of numerous observational products. Gridded gauge-based products dating back to the 19th century reveal pronounced decadal variability. Trends for India over the whole 20th century are inconclusive, although declining over central and northern areas. Assessment of multiple observational datasets covering the Indian summer monsoon reveals significant declining rainfall over the second half of the 20th century. A subsequent recovery has been noted since the early 2000s. Observational products containing critical inhomogeneities in gauge distribution and reporting over time are acknowledged as suitable for mesoscale analysis, while use for climate trends requires consistent reporting over time from quality-controlled gauges. A newer 0.25-gridded product covering 1901 onwards, based on Shepards interpolation method for irregularly-spaced stations, shows increased intensity of daily rainfall and extremes over some regions, especially in the late-20th century. However, changes to the inputted gauges may have introduced an artificial jump in extreme rainfall since 1975 over central India. They suggest that this method may have masked declines in mean rainfall and highlight the need for availability of raw gauge data to allow transparent assessments. Khouider et al. have successfully tested a probabilistic interpolation method for India to overcome problems inherent in algorithms based on inverse-distance weighting when applied to data-sparse regions. An example snapshot of the uneven distribution of rain gauges in a common observational product is shown in Figure 10.19a. The uncertainty among local and international observational products for India can pose challenges when evaluating climate models. For the seasonal mean summer monsoon rainfall, Collins et al. found large biases separating many CMIP5 models from the available"}

However, for seasonal mean variability, the spread across observational products was larger than across the CMIP5 ensemble. 10.6.3.4 Relevant anthropogenic and natural drivers for long-term change The relevant drivers for long-term change in the mean Indian summer monsoon are summarised briefly:  Increased greenhouse gas concentrations are a strong contributor to changes in the monsoon, with repercussions for the meridional temperature contrast driving the monsoon circulation, for the monsoon winds in the lower troposphere, or for the availability of moisture from the Indian Ocean.  Industrial emissions of sulphate aerosol predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere could change inter-hemispheric energy transports and weaken the monsoon. The effect of local anthropogenic emissions of black carbon is uncertain.  Indias green revolution over the late-20th century led to considerable land-use change, with massive expansion of agriculture at the expense of forest and shrublands. As a result, Indias northern plains feature widespread irrigation, suggested to be a cause of drying.  Decadal modes of variability such as the Pacific Decadal Variability and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, which may be partly forced, are known to cause decadal modulation of the monsoon."}

Assessing the attribution of 20th-century changes to Indian rainfall is the subject of coordinated modelling under the Global Monsoon MIP, but is complicated by long-standing dry biases in coupled CMIP3, CMIP5 and CMIP6 GCMs. These dry biases are connected to a lower tropospheric circulation that is too weak and wet biases in the equatorial Indian Ocean. Section 8.3.2.4.1 finds high confidence that anthropogenic aerosol emissions have dominated the observed declining trends of countrywide Indian summer monsoon rainfall, consistent with findings at the global-monsoon scale. Stronger Northern Hemisphere aerosol emissions cool it relative to the Southern Hemisphere, increasing northward energy transport at the expense of moisture transport towards India. The attribution to anthropogenic aerosols is supported in CMIP5 single-forcing experiments, including some testing the sensitivity to local and remote emissions, comparing CMIP5 GCMs forced by both aerosol and GHG to GHG only and reducing emissions to pre-industrial levels. The large spread between individual model realisations of comparable magnitude to the aerosol-induced signal suggested to Salzmann et al. that internal variability may also play a role over regions such as northern-central India. Further uncertainty surrounds the level of radiative forcing. Dittus et al. forced a GCM with historical aerosol emissions scaled between 0.2 and 1.5 times their observed values, representing the spread in CMIP5 effective radiative forcing. The strongest forcing led to around 0.5 mm day-1 less late-20th century Indian monsoon rainfall than the weakest. Meanwhile, the uncertainty surrounding aerosol-cloud interactions could change the sign of long-term precipitation trends. There is some evidence that declining Indian monsoon rainfall is due to regional SST warming patterns, themselves arising due to radiative forcing from GHG. Roxy"}

Under divergent air-quality policies, SSP3 features a dipole of declining sulphate emissions for China but increases over India, leading to suppression of GHG-related precipitation increases there. For the near-term future around the mid-21st century, the interplay between internal variability and external forcing must be considered. Huang et al. used two SMILEs to show that internal variability related to PDV could potentially overcome the GHG-forced upward trend in Indian monsoon rainfall, consistent with assessments of the global monsoon for the near term. Emergence of the anthropogenic signal for South Asian precipitation is shown from the 2050s onwards in CMIP6. In long-term projections, robust signals consist of a weakened upper-tropospheric meridional temperature gradient, either due to upper-level heating over the tropical Pacific or Indian Oceans in CMIP5, and increased seasonal mean rainfall, including in CMIP6. The weakened temperature gradient combines with increased atmospheric stability to weaken the monsoon overturning circulation, with some findings showing northward movement of the lower-tropospheric monsoon winds in response to a stronger land-sea temperature contrast in CMIP3 and CMIP5. The northward shift was also found in the genesis of synoptic systems in a single high-resolution atmospheric GCM forced by an ensemble of SSTs derived from four GCMs under the RCP8.5 scenario. Projections can also be expressed in terms of global-mean warming levels rather than time horizons. Advancing upon SR1.5, amplification of mean and extreme monsoon rainfall at 2.0C compared to 1.5C has been found both by an atmospheric GCM forced by future SST patterns and using time slices in CMIP5 GCMs. These findings are consistent with the general scaling of Indian monsoon precipitation per degree of warming in CMIP5 and CMIP6. Increasing GWLs also lead to emergence of the anthropogenic signal over larger proportions of the South Asian region. Decomposition of the increased rainfall signal showed that while the dynamic component led to a drying tendency, this was overcome by the thermodynamic contribution. Alternative decomposition experiments using atmospheric GCMs and their coupled counterparts found increases in the lower-tropospheric temperature gradient and monsoon rainfall to be dominated by the fast radiative response to GHG increase rather than SST changes. The response to SST forcing featured a large model spread, particularly arising from the dynamic component. Chen and Zhou found that the Indo-Pacific SST warming pattern dominated the uncertainty in Indian monsoon rainfall change. Finally, in assessing the relative impact of CO2 radiative forcing and plant physiological changes in quadrupled CO2 experiments in four Earth system models, Cui et al. showed little impact of plant physiology on annual rainfall for the Indian region. While several of the above studies selected model subsets to constrain future projections based on standard performance metrics of the historical period, such as pattern correlation and root-mean-square error, Latif et al. included a performance measure based on agreement with historical rainfall trends. This is an unproven constraint for regional projections, since the 20th-century rainfall trend over India is assessed to have been driven chiefly by aerosol and other factors such as PDV, while the dominant late-21st century forcing is GHG emissions. Modern emergent-constraint techniques are being applied to the Indian monsoon such as Li et al., who found that models with excessive tropical western Pacific rainfall tend to project a greater Indian monsoon rainfall change in future, due to an exaggerated cloud-radiation feedback. Correcting for this bias reduces the future change. Figure 10.19: Changes in the Indian summer monsoon in the historical and future periods.

They noted increases in rainfall of 1524% for India. Finally, evidence from a single CORDEX South Asia RCM showed a mixed signal for changes in peak season rainfall under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Statistical downscaling and other post-processing require calibration in historical conditions and assessment of fitness for purpose before use for future projections. Given the noted biases in GCM monsoon simulation, Vigaud et al. used a variant of quantile mapping to bias adjust GCM outputs. For the historical period, the pattern, mean and seasonal cycle of rainfall versus the input GCMs were improved. Increased future monsoon rain, albeit in older SRES A2 projections, was found for southern India. Salvi et al. used regression-based perfect prognosis for the whole country at 0.5resolution based on five ensemble members of a GCM in SRES scenarios. They noted increases over rainy regions of west coast and northeast India, but decreases in the north, west and southeast. Madhusoodhanan et al. statistically downscaled 20 CMIP5 models to 0.05-resolution. While the GCMs projected increased rainfall, the downscaled ensemble depicted both increasing and decreasing trends, indicating uncertainty. However, key physical processes operating at below-GCM scale cannot be resolved nor calibrated for, such as aspects of the flow around topography. This is notably an issue given the resolution disparity between the driving GCMs and output, and the regional challenges in observational data used for calibration. There are mixed messages as to whether downscaling adds value to climate projections of the Indian summer monsoon; however, there is high confidence in projections of precipitation changes in orographic regions given the consistent improved representation in these regions among several dynamical downscaling studies. 10.6.3.8 Storyline approaches for India Formal storyline approaches have been used infrequently for the Indian summer monsoon, representing a knowledge gap. In an expert-elicitation approach, physically plausible futures substantiated by climate processes were constructed, focusing on a river basin in southern India. Possible outcomes were framed based on changes in two drivers: availability of moisture from the Arabian Sea and strength of the low-level flow. The narratives identified were able to explain 70% of the variance in monsoon rainfall over 19792013, the implication being that climate uncertainties could be easily communicated to stakeholders in the context of present-day variability. The storylines terminology could be used to loosely describe the interplay between internal variability and forced change, such as considering the difference between groups of wettest and driest ensemble members of a SMILE for the near-term future in Figure 10.19f. However, given the interest in lowlikelihood high-impact scenarios, we can also consider possible storylines for the Indian monsoon constructed from evidence in paleoclimate records and modelling. For example, a future AMOC collapse could cause reduced monsoon rainfall, offsetting increases expected due to GHG. Large tropical volcanic eruptions are also known to weaken the Asian summer monsoon, in observations and model simulations over the last millennium, although a hemispheric dependence is found, with southern hemisphere eruptions even strengthening the monsoon around India. Typically, future climate projections do not consider plausible eruption scenarios and their mitigating effects on greenhouse warming. A singlemodel ensemble demonstrates a future drier Indian monsoon relative to conditions in which volcanic eruptions are not considered, although the effects of GHG warming dominate beyond the mid-term. The few studies on low-likelihood high-impact scenarios, often in single models, together with findings in SR1.5, noting the small radiative forcing in 1.5C or 2C scenarios, or the absence of large aerosol emissions at the end of the 21st century in RCPs, give us low confidence in abrupt changes to the monsoon on this time scale."}

Miscellaneous lines of evidence are considered here. Our assessment could also be informed by attempting to constrain future projections of the Indian summer monsoon using paleoclimate evidence. In modelling work of the mid-Holocene, the increased obliquity and altered orbital precession lead to an enhanced monsoon with a stronger dynamic component controlling the increase in monsoon rainfall. In future climates however, the dynamic contribution decreases, yet the increased thermodynamic component overcomes this to cause a wetter monsoon. Monsoon changes under different epochs may not be governed by the same mechanisms, making the mid-Holocene, in particular, unsuitable as a period to compare with. Finally, the recent national climate-change assessment for India has distilled multiple lines of evidence to show declining summer monsoon rainfall over the second half of the 20th century, attributable to emissions of anthropogenic aerosols, while future projections informed by CMIP5 modelling and dominated by GHG forcing show increased mean rainfall by the end of the 21st century. There is very high confidence of a negative trend of summer monsoon rainfall over the second half of the 20th century averaged over all of India. There is medium agreement over trends at the regional level owing to uncertainty among observational products, which hinders model evaluation, downscaling and assessment of changes to extremes. There is high confidence that anthropogenic aerosol emissions over the Northern Hemisphere and internal variability have contributed to the negative trend, while there is high confidence that Indian summer monsoon rainfall will increase at the end of the 21st century in response to increased GHG forcing, due to the dominance of thermodynamic mechanisms. No contradictory evidence is found from downscaling methods. The contrast between declining rainfall in the observational record and long-term future increases can be explained using multiple lines of evidence. They are not contradictory since they are attributable to different mechanisms. The long-term future changes are generally consistent across global and regional climate models, and supported by theoretical arguments; furthermore, while there are subtle differences found in past periods with a climate similar to the future climate, different physical mechanisms at play suggest that paleoclimate evidence does not reduce confidence in the future projections. In the near term, there is high confidence that internal variability will dominate. 10.6.4 Mediterranean Summer Warming 10.6.4.1 Motivation and regional context The Mediterranean region is loosely denoted as the region that surrounds the Mediterranean Sea, and it is characterized by complex orography and strong land-sea contrasts. The region contains a dense and growing human population, with large regional differences: whereas the population of the European Mediterranean countries has been relatively stable or even declining during the past decades, the population of countries in Mediterranean areas of the Middle East and North Africa has quadrupled between 1960 and 2015, and the degree of urbanization has risen from 35 to 64% during the same period and during the more recent period 2000-2020 the urban expansion rate has exceeded 5%. The Mediterranean region has experienced significant climate variability over recent decades and has been affected in particular by severe heatwaves and droughts (Hoegh-Guldberg et al.; Sections 8.3, 11.3, 11.6 and 12.4). Increasing summer temperatures will enhance the frequency and intensity of such extreme events and will cause additional environmental and socio-economic pressure on the region."}

There is a general lack of studies of the simulation of large-scale, downscaling-relevant processes in global models to support the design of global/regional model matrices that both span a sufficiently large range of projection uncertainty and realistically represent the regional climate of interest. The fitness of statistical methods for regional climate change studies has received limited attention by the scientific community, while as in the case of global models, process-based evaluation has proven useful. Studies of past changes and pseudo-reality studies to assess the predictors and model structures required for downscaling in a future climate are promising avenues.  Internal variability is a large contributor to climate uncertainty at regional scales, especially for extreme events. Further study of the processes governing regional internal variability, such as the modes of variability and the teleconnections that connect them to the regional variability, but also of the local processes and drivers involved, will help improve its understanding. The same applies to the validation of the simulated internal variability that underpins the trustworthiness of model-based climate information.  Methodologies on how to propagate climate uncertainties from global and regional scales down to the human settlement scale are still under development. In some cases, bias-adjustment methods are used with substantial neglect of the physical processes involved.  The production of regional climate information relies mainly on global and regional models that often do not incorporate human-controlled surface processes in their land-surface components. This limits the representation of uncertainties for climate information at the urban scale.  Literature plays a central role as a source for constructing regional climate change information. The amount of climate change literature available is unevenly distributed across the world, and large bodies of literature are often overlooked in the construction of climate information. Furthermore, research tends to focus on regions that attract the attention of the Global North so that climate aspects relevant to other regions may not receive sufficient attention for generating appropriate regional climate information.  Governmental institutions producing regional and local climate information often use diverging approaches that are not necessarily coherent with each other. Coherency could be improved by implementing a quality control system and a traceability solution for the sources of the information. Collective work with the social sciences and humanities will improve the communication, perception and response to regional climate information and help translate user requirements.  There is a shortage of regional climate change studies distilling multiple lines of evidence. Most studies rely on either global models or downscaled global models, with an increasing number of studies focusing on the use of emulators and the selection and combination of models. However, there are limited studies distilling this information with a wider range of lines of evidence that includes observations, process understanding, attribution, and hierarchies of models."}

It assesses observed changes in extremes, their attribution to causes, and future projections, at three global warming levels: 1.5C, 2C, 4C. This chapter is also one of the four regional chapters of the WGI report. Consequently, while it encompasses assessments of changes in extremes at global and continental scales to provide a large-scale context, it also addresses changes in extremes at regional scales. Extremes are climatic impact-drivers. The IPCC risk framework articulates clearly that the exposure and vulnerability to climatic impact-drivers, such as extremes, modulate the risk of adverse impacts of these drivers, and that adaptation that reduces exposure and vulnerability will increase resilience resulting in a reduction in impacts. Nonetheless, changes in extremes lead to changes in impacts not only as a direct consequence of changes in their magnitude and frequency, but also through their influence on exposure and resilience. The Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation provided a comprehensive assessment on changes in extremes and how exposure and vulnerability to extremes determine the impacts and likelihood of disasters. Chapter 3 of that report assessed physical aspects of extremes, and laid a foundation for the follow-up IPCC assessments. Several chapters of the WGI AR5 addressed climate extremes with respect to observed changes, model evaluation, attribution, and projected long-term changes. Assessments were also provided in the recent IPCC Special Reports on 1.5C global warming, on climate change and land, and on oceans and the cryosphere. These assessments are the starting point of the present assessment. This chapter is structured as follows. This Section provides the general framing and introduction to the chapter, highlighting key aspects that underlie the confidence and uncertainty in the assessment of changes in extremes, and introducing some main elements of the chapter. To provide readers a quick overview of past and future changes in extremes, a synthesis of global scale assessment for different types of extremes is included at the end of this Section. Section 11.2 introduces methodological aspects of research on climate extremes. Sections 11.3 to 11.7 assess past changes and their attribution to causes, and projected future changes in extremes, for different types of extremes, including temperature extremes, heavy precipitation and pluvial floods, river floods, droughts, and storms, in separate sections. Section 11.8 addresses compound events. Section 11.9 summarizes regional assessments of changes in temperature extremes, in precipitation extremes and in droughts by continents in tables. The chapter also includes several boxes and FAQs on more specific topics. Figure 11.1: Chapter 11 visual abstract of contents. 11.1.2 What are extreme events and how are their changes studied?

Station-based indices would have the same issues as those for the mean climate regarding the quality, availability, and homogeneity of the data. For the purpose of constructing regional information and/or for comparison with model outputs, such as model evaluation, and detection and attribution, these station-based indices are often interpolated onto regular grids. Two different approaches, involving two different orders of operation, have been used in producing such gridded datasets. In some cases, such as for the HadEX3 dataset, indices of extremes are computed using time series directly derived from stations first and are then gridded over the space. As the indices are computed at the station level, the gridded data products represent point estimates of the indices averaged over the spatial scale of the grid box. In other instances, daily values of station observations are first gridded, and the interpolated values can then be used to compute various indices by the users. Depending on the station density, values for extremes computed from data gridded this way represent extremes of spatial scales anywhere from the size of the grid box to a point. In regions with high station density, the gridded values are closer to extremes of area means and are thus more appropriate for comparisons with extremes estimated from climate model output, which is often considered to represent areal means. In regions with very limited station density, the gridded values are closer to point estimates of extremes. The difference in spatial scales among observational data products and model simulations needs to be carefully accounted for when interpreting the comparison among different data products. For example, the average annual maximum daily maximum temperature over land computed from the original ERA-interim reanalysis is about 0.4C warmer than that computed when the ERA-interim dataset is upscaled to the resolution of 2.5 x 3.75. Extreme indices computed from various reanalysis data products have been used in some studies, but reanalysis extreme statistics have not been rigorously compared to observations. In general, changes in temperature extremes from various reanalyses were most consistent with gridded observations after about 1980, but larger differences were found during the pre-satellite era. Overall, lower agreement across reanalysis datasets was found for extreme precipitation changes, although temporal and spatial correlations against observations were found to be still significant. In regions with sparse observations, there is generally less agreement for extreme precipitation between different reanalysis products, indicating a consequence of the lack of an observational constraint in these regions. More recent reanalyses, such as ERA5, seem to have improved over previous products, at least over some regions. Caution is needed when reanalysis data products are used to provide additional information about past changes in these extremes in regions where observations are generally lacking. Satellite remote sensing data have been used to provide information about precipitation extremes because several products provide data at sub-daily resolution for precipitation and clouds. However, satellites do not observe the primary atmospheric state variables directly and polar orbiting satellites do not observe any given place at all times. Hence, their utility as a substitute for high-frequency ground-based observations is limited. For instance, Timmermans et al. found little relationship between the timing of extreme daily and five-day precipitation in satellite and gridded station data products over the United States. BOX 11.3: Extremes in paleoclimate archives compared to instrumental records Examining extremes in pre-instrumental information can help to put events occurring in the instrumental record in a longer-term context. This box focuses on extremes in the Common Era, because there is generally higher confidence in pre-instrumental information gathered from the more recent archives from the Common Era than from earlier evidence. It addresses evidence of extreme events in paleo reconstructions, documentary evidence and model-based analyses, and whether observed extremes"}

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table. Atmospheric model simulations are often used in event attribution studies to assess the influence of global warming on observed temperature-related extremes. These simulations typically capture the observed trends in temperature extremes, though some regional features, such as the lack of warming in daytime warm temperature extremes over South America and parts of North America, are not reproduced in the model simulations, possibly due to internal variability, deficiencies in local surface processes, or forcings that are not represented in the SSTs. Additionally, the AMIP models assessed tend to produce overly persistent heat wave events. This bias in the duration of the events does not impact the reliability of the models positive trends. Several regional climate models have also been evaluated in terms of their performance in simulating the climatology of extremes in various regions of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment, especially in East Asia, Europe, and Africa. Compared to GCMs, RCM simulations show an added value in simulating temperature-related extremes, though this depends on topographical complexity and the parameters employed. The improvement with resolution is noted in East Asia. However, in the European CORDEX ensemble, different aerosol climatologies with various degrees of complexity were used in projections and the land surface models used in the RCMs do not account for physiological CO2 effects on photosynthesis leading to enhanced wateruse efficiency and decreased evapotranspiration, which could lead to biases in the representation of temperature extremes in these projections. In addition, there are key cold biases in temperature extremes over areas with complex topography. Over North America, 12 RCMs were evaluated over the ARCTIC-CORDEX region. Models were able to simulate well climate indices related to mean air temperature and hot extremes over most of the Canadian Arctic, with the exception of the Yukon region where models displayed the largest biases related to topographic effects. Two RCMs were evaluated against observed extremes indices over North America over the period 19892009, with a cool bias in minimum temperature extremes shown in both RCMs. The most significant biases are found in TXx and TNn, with fewer differences in the simulation of annual minimum daily maximum temperature and annual maximum daily minimum temperature in central and western North America. Over Central and South America, maximum temperatures from the Eta RCM are generally underestimated, although hot days, warm nights, and heat waves are increasing in the period 1961-1990, in agreement with observations. Some land forcings are not well represented in climate models. As highlighted in the IPCC SRCCL Ch2, there is high agreement that temperate deforestation leads to summer warming and winter cooling (Bright et al., 2017; Zhao and Jackson, 2014; Galos et al., 2011, 2013; Wickham et al., 2013; Ahlswede and Thomas,"}

Increases have been observed over Jakarta, but Rx1day over most parts of the Maritime Continent has decreased. Trends in extreme precipitation over China are mixed with increases and decreases and are not significant over China as whole. With few exceptions, most Southeast Asian countries have experienced an increase in rainfall intensity, but with a reduced number of wet days, though large differences in trends exists if the trends are estimated from different datasets including gauge-based, remotely-sensed, and reanalysis over a relatively short period. There is a significant increase in heavy rainfall and a significant decrease in moderate rainfall in central India during the South Asian monsoon season. In Australasia, available evidence has not shown an increase or a decrease in heavy precipitation over Australasia as a whole, but heavy precipitation tends to increase over northern Australia and decrease over the eastern and southern regions. Available studies that used long-term observations since the mid-20th century showed nearly as many stations with an increase as those with a decrease in heavy precipitation or slightly more stations with a decrease than with an increase in Rx1day and Rx5day, or strong differences in Rx1day trends with increases over northern Australia and central Australia in general but mostly decreases over southern Australia and eastern Australia. Over New Zealand, decreases are observed for moderate-heavy precipitation events, but there are no significant trends for very heavy events for the period 1951-2012. The number of stations with an increase in very wet days is similar to that with a decrease during 1960-2019. Overall, there is low confidence in trends in the frequency of heavy rain days with mostly decreases over New Zealand. In Central and South America, evidence shows an increase in extreme precipitation, but in general there is low confidence; while continent-wide analyses produced wetting trends, trends are not robust. Rx1day increased at more stations than it decreased in South America between 1950-2018. Over 1950-2010, both Rx5day and R99p increased over large regions of South America, including NWS, NSA, and SES. There are large regional differences. A decrease in daily extreme precipitation is observed in northeastern Brazil. Trends in extreme precipitation indices were not statistically significant over the period 1947-2012 within the Sao Francisco River basin in the Brazilian semi-arid region. An increase in extreme rainfall is observed in AMZ with medium confidence and in SES with high confidence. Among all sub-regions, SES shows the highest rate of increase for rainfall extremes, followed by AMZ. Increases in the intensity of heavy daily rainfall events have been observed in the southern Pacific and in the Titicaca basin. In SCA trends in annual precipitation are generally not significant, although small increases are found in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Panama. Small positive trends were found in multiple extreme precipitation indices over the Caribbean region over a short time period In Europe, there is robust evidence that the magnitude and intensity of extreme precipitation has very likely increased since the 1950s.

There is high confidence that atmospheric dynamics, which varies on interannual, decadal and longer time scales, is the dominant contributor to variations in precipitation deficits in the majority of the world regions. Precipitation deficits are driven by dynamic mechanisms taking place on different spatial scales, including synoptic processes atmospheric rivers and extratropical cyclones, blocking and ridges, dominant large-scale circulation patterns, and global ocean-atmosphere coupled patterns such as IPO, AMO and ENSO. These various mechanisms occur on different scales, are not independent, and substantially interact with one another. Also regional moisture recycling and land-atmosphere feedbacks play an important role for some precipitation anomalies. There is high confidence that land-atmosphere feedbacks play a substantial or dominant role in affecting precipitation deficits in some regions. The sign of the feedbacks can be either positive or negative, as well as local or non-local. ESMs tend to underestimate non-local negative soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks and also show high variations in their representation in some regions. Soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks contribute to changes in precipitation in climate model projections in some regions, but ESMs display substantial uncertainties in their representation, and there is thus only low confidence in these contributions. 11.6.1.2 Atmospheric evaporative demand Atmospheric evaporative demand quantifies the maximum amount of actual evapotranspiration that can happen from land surfaces if they are not limited by water availability. AED is affected by both radiative and aerodynamic components. For this reason, the atmospheric dryness, often quantified with the relative humidity or the vapor pressure deficit, is not equivalent to the AED, as other variables are also highly relevant, including solar radiation and wind speed. AED can be estimated using different methods. Methods solely based on air temperature usually overestimate it in terms of magnitude and temporal trends, in particular in the context of substantial background warming. Physically-based combination methods such as the Penman-Monteith equation are more adequate and recommended since 1998 by the Food and Agriculture Oganization. For this reason, the assessment of this chapter, when considering atmospheric-based drought indices, only includes AED estimates using the latter. AED is generally higher than ET, since it represents an upper bound for it. Hence, an AED increase does not necessarily lead to increased ET, in particular under drought conditions given soil moisture limitation. In general, AED is highest in regions where ET is lowest, further illustrating the decoupling between the two variables under limited soil moisture. The influence of AED on drought depends on the drought type, background climate, the environmental conditions and the moisture availability. This influence also includes effects not related to increased ET. Under low soil moisture conditions, increased AED increases plant stress, enhancing the severity of agricultural and ecological droughts. Moreover, high VPD impacts overall plant physiology; it affects the leaf and xylem safety margins, and decreases the sap velocity and plant hydraulic conductance. VPD also affects the plant metabolism of carbon and if prolongued, it may cause plant mortality via carbon starvation."}

Despite the mentioned model limitations, the representation of soil moisture processes in ESMs uses physical and biological understanding of the underlying processes, which can represent well the temporal anomalies associated with temporal variability and trends in climate. In summary, there is medium confidence in the representation of soil moisture deficits in ESMs and related land surface and hydrological models. 11.6.3.4 Hydrological deficits Streamflow and groundwater are not directly simulated by ESMs, which only simulate runoff, but they are generallyn represented in hydrological models, which are typically driven in a stand-alone manner by observed or simulated climate forcing. The simulation of hydrological deficits is much more problematic than the simulation of mean streamflow or peak flows, since models tend to be too responsive to the climate forcing and do not satisfactorily capture low flows. Simulations of hydrological drought metrics show uncertainties related to the contribution of both GCMs and hydrological models, but hydrological models forced by the same climate input data also show a large spread. At the catchment scale, the hydrological model uncertainty is higher than both GCM and downscaling uncertainty, and the hydrological models show issues in representing drought propagation throughout the hydrological cycle. A study on the evaluation of streamflow droughts in seven global models compared with observations in near-natural catchments of Europe showed a substantial spread among models, an overestimation of the number of drought events, and an underestimation of drought duration and drought-affected area. 11.6.3.5 Atmospheric-based drought indices A number of studies have analysed the ability of models to capture drought severity and trends based on climatic drought indices. Given the limitations of ESMs in reproducing the dynamic of precipitation deficits and AED, atmospheric-based drought indices derived from ESM data for these two variables are also affected by uncertainties and biases. A comparison of historical trends in PDSI-PM for 1950-2014 derived from CMIP3 and CMIP5 with respective estimates derived from observations show a similar behaviour at global scale, but low spatial agreement in the trends except in a few regions. In future projections there is an important spread in PDSI-PM and SPEI-PM among different models. 11.6.3.6 Synthesis for different drought types The performance of ESMs used to assessed changes in variables related to meteorological droughts, agricultural and ecological droughts, and hydrological droughts, show the presence of biases and uncertainties compared to observations, but there is medium confidence in their overall performance for assessing drought projections given process understanding. Given the substantial inter-model spread documented for all related variables, the consideration of multi-model projections increases the confidence of model-based assessments, with only low confidence in assessments based on single models. In summary, the evaluation of ESMs, land surface and hydrological models for the simulation of droughts is complex, due to the regional scale of drought trends, their overall low signal-to-noise ratio, and the lack of observations in several regions, in particular for soil moisture and streamflow. There is medium confidence in the ability of ESMs to simulate trends and anomalies in precipitation deficits and AED, and also medium"}

Several studies suggest that increasing atmospheric CO2 could lead to reduced leaf stomatal conductance, which would increase water-use efficiency and reduce plant water needs, thus limiting ET. The implemention of a CO2-dependent land resistance parameter has been suggested for the estimation of AED. Nevertheless, there are other relevant mechanisms, as soil moisture deficits and VPD also play an importantrole in the control of the leaf stomatal conductance and a number of ecophysiological and anatomical processes affect the response of plant physiology under higheratmospheric CO2 concentrations. The benefits of the atmospheric CO2 for plant stress and agricultural and ecological droughts would be minimal precisely during dry periods given stomatal closure in response to limited soil moisture. In addition, CO2 effects on plant stomatal conductance could not entirely compensate the increased demand associated to warming; in large tropical and subtropical regions, AED is projected to increase even considering the possible CO2 effects on the land resistance. Moreover, these CO2 effects would not affect the direct evaporation from soils and water bodies, which is very relevant in the reservoirs of warm areas. Because of these uncertainties, there is low confidence whether increased CO2-induced water-use efficiency in vegetation will substantially reduce global plant transpiration and will diminish the frequency and severity of soil moisture and streamflow deficits associated with the radiative effect of higher CO2 concentrations. Another mechanism reducing the ET response to increased AED in projections is the control of soil moisture limitations on ET, which leads to reduced stomatal conductance under water stress. This response may be further amplified through VPD-induced decreases in stomatal conductance. However, the decreased stomatal conductance in response to both soil moisture limitation and enhanced CO2 would further enhance AED, whereby the overall effects on AED in ESMs are found to be of similar magnitude for soil moisture limitation and CO2 physiological effects on stomatal conductance. Increased AED is thus both a driver and a feedback with respect to changes in ET, complicating the interpretation of its role on drought changes with increasing CO2 concentrations and global warming. 11.6.5.3 Soil moisture deficits Areas with projected soil moisture decreases do not fully coincide with areas with projected precipitation decreases, although there is substantial consistency in the respective patterns. There are, however, more regions affected by increased soil moisture deficits than precipitation deficits, as a consequence of enhanced AED and the associated increased ET, as highlighted by some studies. Moisture in the top soil layer is projected to decrease more than precipitation at all warming levels, extending the regions affected by severe soil moisture deficits over most of south and central Europe, southern North America, South America, southern Africa, East Africa, southern Australia, India and East Asia. Projected changes in total soil moisture display less widespread drying than those for surface soil moisture, but still more than for precipitation. The severity of droughts based on surface soil moisture in future projections is stronger than projections based on precipitation and runoff. Nevertheless, in many parts of the world in which soil moisture is projected to decrease, the signal to noise ratio among models is low and only in the Mediterranean, Europe, the southwestern United States, and southern Africa the projections show a"}

The observed poleward trend in western North Pacific TCs remains significant after accounting for the known modes of dominant interannual to decadal variability in the region, and is also found in CMIP5 model-simulated TCs, although it is weaker than observed and is not statistically significant. However, the trend is significant in 21st century CMIP5 projections under the RCP8.5 scenario, with a similar spatial pattern and magnitude to the past observed changes in that basin over the period 19452016, supporting a possible anthropogenic GHG contribution to the observed trends. The recent active TC seasons in some basins have been studied to determine whether there is anthropogenic influence. For 2015, Murakami et al. explored the unusually high TC frequency near Hawaii and in the eastern Pacific basin. Zhang et al. considered unusually high Accumulated Cyclone Energy in the western North Pacific. Yang et al. and Yamada et al. looked at TC intensification in the western North Pacific. These studies suggest that the anomalous TC activity in 2015 was not solely explained by the effect of an extreme El Nino, that there was also an anthropogenic contribution, mainly through the effects of SSTs in subtropical regions. In the post-monsoon seasons of 2014 and 2015, tropical storms with lifetime maximum winds greater than 46 m s1 were first observed over the Arabian Sea, and Murakami et al. showed that the probability of late-season severe tropical storms is increased by anthropogenic forcing compared to the preindustrial era. Murakami et al. concluded that the active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was mainly caused by pronounced SSTs in the tropical North Atlantic and that these types of seasonal events will intensify with projected anthropogenic forcing. The trans-basin SST change, which might be driven by anthropogenic aerosol forcing, also affects TC activity. Takahashi et al. suggested that a decrease in sulfate aerosol emissions caused about half of the observed decreasing trends in TC genesis frequency in the south-eastern region of the western North Pacific during 19922011. Event attribution is used in case studies of TCs to test whether the severities of recent intense TCs are explained without anthropogenic effects. In a case study of Hurricane Sandy, Lackmann found no statistically significant impact of anthropogenic climate change on storm intensity, while projections in a warmer world showed significant strengthening. On the other hand, Magnusson et al. found that in ECMWF simulations, the simulated cyclone depth and intensity, as well as precipitation, were larger when the model was driven by the warmer actual SSTs than the climatological average SSTs. In super typhoon Haiyan, which struck the Philippines on 8 November 2013, Takayabu et al. took an event attribution approach with cloud system-resolving downscaling ensemble experiments to evaluate the anthropogenic effect on typhoons, and showed that the intensity of the simulated worst case storm in the actual conditions was stronger than that in a hypothetical condition without historical anthropogenic forcing in the model. However, in a similar approach with two coarser parameterized convection models, Wehner et al. found conflicting human influences on Haiyans intensity. Patricola and Wehner found little evidence of an attributable change in intensity of hurricanes Katrina, Irma, and Maria using a regional climate model configured between 3 and 4.5 km resolution. They did, however, find attributable increases in heavy precipitation totals. These results imply that higher resolution, such as in a convective permitting 5-km or less mesh model, is required to obtain a robust anthropogenic intensification of a strong TC by simulating realistic rapid intensification of a TC, and that whether the intensification of TCs can be attributed to the recent warming depends on the case. The dominant factor in the extreme rainfall amounts during Hurricane Harveys passage onto the U.S. in 2017 was its slow translation speed. But studies published after the event have argued that anthropogenic climate change contributed to an increase in rain rate, which compounded the extreme local rainfall caused by the slow translation. Emanuel used a large set of synthetically-generated storms and concluded that the occurrence of extreme rainfall as observed in Harvey was substantially enhanced by anthropogenic changes to the larger-scale ocean and atmosphere characteristics. Trenberth et al. linked Harveys rainfall totals to the anomalously large ocean heat content from the Gulf of Mexico. van Oldenborgh et al. and Risser and Wehner applied extreme value analysis to extreme rainfall records in the"}

Burnt area extent in western US forests and particularly in California has been linked to anthropogenic climate change via a significant increase in vapour pressure deficit, a primary driver of wildfires. A study of the western US examined the correlation between historical water-balance deficits and annual area burned, across a range of vegetation types from temperate rainforest to desert. The relationship between temperature and dryness, and wildfire, varied with ecosystem type, and the fire-climate relationship was both nonstationary and vegetation-dependent. In many fire-prone regions, such as the Mediterranean and Chinas Daxinganling region, projections for increased severity of future drought and heat waves may lead to an increased frequency of wildfires relative to observed. Observations show a long-term trend towards more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in many regions of Australia, which is attributable at least in part to anthropogenic climate change. There is emerging evidence that recent regional surges in wildland fires are being driven by changing weather extremes. Between 1979 and 2013, the global burnable area affected by long fire-weather seasons doubled, and the mean length of the fire-weather season increased by 19%. However, at the global scale, the total burned area has been decreasing between 1998 and 2015 due to human activities mostly related to changes in land use. Given the projected high confidence increase in compound hot and dry conditions, there is high confidence that fire weather conditions will become more frequent at higher levels of global warming in some regions. This assessment is also consistent with assessments of Chapter 12 for regional projected changes in fire weather. The SRCCL Ch2 assessed with high confidence that future climate variability is expected to enhance the risk and severity of wildfires in many biomes such as tropical rainforests. In summary, there is high confidence that concurrent heat waves and droughts have increased in frequency over the last century at the global scale due to human influence. There is medium confidence that weather conditions that promote wildfires have become more probable in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the US, and Australia over the last century. There is high confidence that compound hot and dry conditions become more probable in nearly all land regions as global mean temperature increases. There is high confidence that fire weather conditions will become more frequent at higher levels of global warming in some regions. BOX 11.4: Case study: Global-scale concurrent climate anomalies at the example of the 2015-2016 extreme El Nino and the 2018 boreal spring/summer extremes Occurrence of concurrent or near-concurrent extremes in different parts of a region, or in different locations around the world challenges adaptation and risk management capacity. This can occur as a result of natural climate variability, as climates in different parts of the world are inter-connected through teleconnections. In addition, in a warming climate, the probability of having several locations being affected simultaneously by e.g. hot extremes and heat waves increases strongly as a function of global warming, with detectable changes even for changes as small as +0.5C of additional global warming. Recent articles have highlighted the risks associated with concurrent extremes over large spatial scales. There is evidence that such global-scale extremes associated with hot temperature extremes are increasing in occurrence. Hereafter, the focus is on two recent global-scale events that featured concurrent extremes in several regions across the world. The first focuses on concurrent extremes driven by variability in tropical Pacific SSTs associated with the 2015-2016 extreme El Nino, while the second is a case study of the impacts of global warming combined with abnormal atmospheric circulation patterns in the 2018 boreal spring/summer."}

The impact of the 2015-2016 extreme El Nino on vegetation systems via drought was also shown from satellite data. Overall, tropical forests were a carbon source to the atmosphere during the 20152016 El Nino5 related drought, with some estimates suggesting that up to 2.3 PgC were released. The 2015-2016 extreme El Nino has induced extreme precipitation in some regions. Severe rainfall events were observed in Chennai city in India in Devember 2015 and Yangtze river region in China in June-July 2016, and it was shown that these rainfall events are partly attributed to the 2015-2016 extreme El Nino. In 2015, the activity of tropical cyclones was notably high in the North Pacific. Over the western North Pacific, the number of category 4 and 5 Tropical Cyclones was 13, which is more than twice its typical annual value of 6.3. Similarly, a record-breaking number of TCs was observed in the eastern North Pacific, particularly in the western part of that domain. These extraordinary TC activities were related to the average SST anomaly during that year, which were associated with the 2015-2016 extreme El Nino and the positive phase of the Pacific Meridional Mode. However, it has been suggested that the intense TC activities in both the western and the eastern North Pacific in 2015 were not only due to the El Nino, but also to a contribution of anthropogenic forcing. The impact of the Indian Ocean SST also was suggested to contribute to the extreme TC activity in the western North Pacific in 2015.
