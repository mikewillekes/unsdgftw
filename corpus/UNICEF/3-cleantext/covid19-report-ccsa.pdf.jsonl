One relevant work line in this regard is to monitor the actions taken by the governments on a daily basis and provide access to this information by means of technological tools that facilitate the dissemination and exchange of practices within the region. This work is being conducted with the support of the United Nations Country Resident Coordinators, who until the moment have reported on more than 1,000 actions taken by the countries. As result of this work, it is observed that the countries of the LAC region have been taking an increasing number of actions, categorized in measure types such as movement restrictions, health, labor, economy, education, and social protection. Even some actions began to be implemented by early January, 93% of the registered actions have been taken between March 10th and 23rd. A quick overview on these is provided below.
