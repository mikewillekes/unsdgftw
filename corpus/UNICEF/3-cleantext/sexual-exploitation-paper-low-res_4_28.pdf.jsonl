Secondary trauma refers to psychological symptoms mimicking PTSD that are acquired through exposure to trauma experienced by another person. Vicarious traumatization refers to profound, harmful changes that occur in professionals views of themselves, the world and others due to ongoing exposure to traumatic material. It is vital for researchers to be proactive in preventing and responding to vicarious traumatization of research team members for the benefit of both researchers and involved boys. Strategies for preventing secondary and vicarious trauma include sufficient screening of research team members for prior experience working with traumatized populations, proper supervision and debriefings, facilitation of a supportive working environment, strengthening team-building and peer-support systems, and educating staff regarding secondary or vicarious trauma, among others.
