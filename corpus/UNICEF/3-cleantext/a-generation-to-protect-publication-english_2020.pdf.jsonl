Ensure national legal frameworks and government development strategies and plans prioritize the elimination of violence, exploitation and abuse of children. The CRC is a binding treaty of international law and, under article 4, requires States Parties to take legal, administrative and other measures to implement its provisions. As Governments have already committed to the 2030 Agenda, it is critically important that its goals and targets are incorporated in national development strategies and plans.  Strengthen monitoring and indicator frameworks of national development strategies and plans. The 2030 Agenda specifies a systematic follow-up and review process at national, regional and global levels to promote accountability, support effective cooperation in achieving the goals and targets, and foster exchanges of best practices and mutual learning. A national monitoring and indicator framework is indispensable to national-level follow-up and review to track progress towards the targets on child protection, among others. A robust monitoring and indicator framework means that relevant institutions have received the mandates, with clear roles and responsibilities as well as adequate resources. The 11 indicators covered in this publication can be used to guide the choice of indicators to measure child protection in the national context.  Promote the use of monitoring and indicator frameworks to benchmark progress, planning, advocacy and resource mobilization. A vigorous monitoring and indicator framework is essential to identifying achievements, challenges, gaps and critical success factors, while also supporting Governments and other stakeholders in making informed policy choices. Such benefits are only possible if the monitoring and indicator framework is used.  Specify population groups and issues for intervention. The 2030 Agenda pledges that no one must be left behind, suggesting that in the national context the goals and targets should be met for all people and for all segments of society. Identifying the most vulnerable population groups will help reach the furthest behind and achieve this vision. Specifying the population groups and issues for intervention will also be the basis for data disaggregation of the indicators to track progress towards the target for these particular groups.  Coordinate data collection initiatives at international and national levels to avoid duplication of efforts and overburdening of national partners. The compilation of indicators on child protection relies on data collected by a variety of national and international institutions. Coordination is essential not only to avoid wasting scarce resources, but also to leverage the strengths of different actors.  Develop standards and protocols for the rigorous, safe and ethical collection of data, including for frequently undercounted populations of children, like those living in institutions or on the streets. The global community has a track record of successful collaboration to advance the measurement agenda, which lays a solid foundation for collectively tackling the existing and emerging challenges.  Ensure national ownership of data collection efforts and invest in national capacity to gather, analyse and interpret data. Governments must retain a leading role in formulating data demands and developing plans to address data needs, which is key to ensuring ownership over the final data products. The urgency to improve national statistical capacity is illustrated by the fact that most of the SDG indicators on child protection are categorized as Tier II, meaning that data are available for less than half of the countries around the world.  Mobilize financial resources to ensure that child protection issues are included in routine data collection efforts.
