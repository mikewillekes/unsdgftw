The movements mobilizing efforts have contributed to dramatic success throughout the decade in many indicators relevant to womens, childrens and adolescents health, such as in reducing maternal and child mortality and in improving child nutrition and education. Yet, inequities have persisted across regions and countries, and within countries.  The number of maternal deaths worldwide dropped from an estimated 451 000 in 2000 to 295 000 in 2017, a reduction of about 35%, with the most significant declines occurring since 2010. These deaths, however, are not evenly distributed and are increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where 86% of all maternal deaths occurred in 2017.  The mortality rate for children aged under 5 years declined by almost 50% between 2000 and 2019, from 76 deaths per 1000 live births to 38.

Such analyses need to consider age patterns in general, as studies have shown that intervention coverage of reproductive and maternal health services varies by age across contexts, often with older women and adolescents experiencing lower coverage and higher risk of poor obstetrical outcomes.26", "sentences": [{"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.S0", "text": "Maternal deaths, similar to the child mortality picture, are increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.S1", "text": "These two regions accounted for approximately 86% of all maternal deaths in 2017."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.S2", "text": "Maternal conditions are a leading cause of adolescent deaths in these two regions, which are also the two regions with the highest adolescent fertility levels.23,24"}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.S3", "text": "Wide variations have been found between West and Central Africa compared with Eastern and Southern Africa, and across countries within each of these two subregions, in factors linked with adolescent sexual behaviour and childbearing, such as normative marriage patterns, desired family size, access to family planning, and awareness of how to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.25"}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.S4", "text": "Research on sub-Saharan Africa has also shown that adolescent girls who live in urban areas, are well educated and are in the higher wealth strata experience lower rates of early marriage, early pregnancy and rates of HIV infection compared with those living in rural areas, with less education and in poverty."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.S5", "text": "Although these findings are not surprising, they point to the importance of deeper dives within regions and within countries to understand the cultural, structural and health systems factors at play so that programmes can be appropriately designed to reach all adolescent girls in need and therefore further drive down maternal deaths overall."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.S6", "text": "Such analyses need to consider age patterns in general, as studies have shown that intervention coverage of reproductive and maternal health services varies by age across contexts, often with older women and adolescents experiencing lower coverage and higher risk of poor obstetrical outcomes.26"}], "entities": [{"id": "504d14ab7178cb09867f19d3a4931533a31684f91e55a3a6ee1aafec5376d064", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.LOC0", "text": "sub-Saharan Africa", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "f624b86059a46f3a6b85c84df00d0ab9d0bca5073b2e6d525d92d9441229b312", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.LOC1", "text": "South Asia", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "6aab9b085d254b97194e9a132d5490222e584366aefe3b7e977fa25b70e3d082", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.LOC7", "text": "West and Central Africa", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "96eca0e929eda410ac12f5ea9104ef9fda91d4347a4010ceb457a79d573c9295", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.LOC8", "text": "Eastern and Southern Africa", "label": "LOC"}, {"id": "504d14ab7178cb09867f19d3a4931533a31684f91e55a3a6ee1aafec5376d064", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG33.PA3.LOC10", "text": "sub-Saharan Africa", "label": "LOC"}]}

Summary data (Table 1.1) show that these countries were far from achieving universal coverage for many interventions even before the pandemic, with larger gaps for family planning, early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding, and treatment of childhood illnesses. The good news is that more than 80% coverage had been achieved for immunization interventions, skilled attendant at birth, and access to at least basic safe drinking water. As will be described later in this report, however, both immunization services and institutional deliveries have plummeted in many parts of the world in the wake of COVID-19, putting millions of women and children at risk of poor health outcomes.", "sentences": [{"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG37.PA2.S0", "text": "A snapshot of the current status of coverage with a core set of health interventions helps to illustrate how the world is doing in reaching all women, children and adolescents with interventions across the continuum of care."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG37.PA2.S1", "text": "Countdown to 2030s signature continuum of care chart includes indicators across the dimensions of family planning, pregnancy, childbirth, postnatal care and childhood, and the cross-cutting area of water and sanitation."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG37.PA2.S2", "text": "Figure 1.3 shows progress on this chart prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in all lowand middle-income countries with available data."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG37.PA2.S3", "text": "Summary data show that these countries were far from achieving universal coverage for many interventions even before the pandemic, with larger gaps for family planning, early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding, and treatment of childhood illnesses."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG37.PA2.S4", "text": "The good news is that more than 80% coverage had been achieved for immunization interventions, skilled attendant at birth, and access to at least basic safe drinking water."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG37.PA2.S5", "text": "As will be described later in this report, however, both immunization services and institutional deliveries have plummeted in many parts of the world in the wake of COVID-19, putting millions of women and children at risk of poor health outcomes."}], "entities": [{"id": "eebe24ec0eee3e52e88c03ea9da5a318f39e5ad5446b499259554c77c3fdf1cc", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG37.PA2.LAW2", "text": "COVID-19", "label": "LAW"}]}

An additional 7 million unintended pregnancies are expected to occur under this scenario.89", "sentences": [{"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.S0", "text": "Models of the potential outcomes of various levels of essential RMNCAH service disruptions show catastrophic consequences and can be useful for encouraging governments and partners to ensure such disruptions do not occur."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.S2", "text": " One model suggests that reductions of about 15% in coverage of key highimpact maternal and child health interventions for six months in 118 lowermiddle-income countries could result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.S3", "text": "Reductions approaching 45% for six months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths.86  "}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.S4", "text": "Other models estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic may erode progress towards HIV and malaria goals."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.S5", "text": "According to findings from a comprehensive review of several mathematical models,87 interruption of antiretroviral therapy for six months would increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV by approximately 1.6 times in a one-year period."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.S6", "text": "Full suspension of PMTCT activities for three months could result in increases in new HIV infections in children by as much as 41% in Mozambique, 81% in Malawi, 53% in Zimbabwe and 70% in Uganda.88  "}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.S7", "text": "Another model suggests that some 47 million women in 114 lower-middleincome countries may be unable to access modern contraceptives if the average lockdown measures continue across those countries for six months with major disruptions to services."}, {"id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.S8", "text": "An additional 7 million unintended pregnancies are expected to occur under this scenario.89"}], "entities": [{"id": "7629d89e8ff685f01a9a24c0f48e1fbcc216cc4df260551d995cd0ed731b8136", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.ORG0", "text": "RMNCAH", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "2e8a238d84ee730c4be91d8582b688619e888f4a376175ecd14e793aa910347b", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.GPE16", "text": "Mozambique", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "e46e98b84eb37c36ed4f3c482677d75c1a8178fd6074d2be1c7ddc9151aa5e6a", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.GPE18", "text": "Malawi", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "13291c08152247c4776a7cde8403a7fe043fce4218633e57501d1034d22cc2e5", "mention_id": "30c721c9923cef5b7a6d8ed3634af0fdfaf93759efbb04eb8143555e44c67122.PG72.PA2.GPE20", "text": "Zimbabwe", "label": "GPE"}]}
