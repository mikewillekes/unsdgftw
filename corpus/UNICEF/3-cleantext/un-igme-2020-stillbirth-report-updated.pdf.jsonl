The group is led by UNICEF and includes members of the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Division, and the World Bank Group. Since 2018, UN IGME has been working on estimating stillbirth indicators. Stillbirths are a marker of maternal health, as well as access to quality care during pregnancy and around the time of birth. Ending preventable stillbirths is among the core goals of the UNs Global Strategy for Womens, Childrens and Adolescents Health (20162030)11 and the Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP).12 These global initiatives aim to reduce the stillbirth rate to 12 or fewer third trimester (late) stillbirths per 1,000 total births in every country by 2030.", "sentences": [{"id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.S0", "text": "The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation was established in 2004 to advance the work on monitoring progress towards the achievement of child survival goals regarding child mortality."}, {"id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.S1", "text": "The group is led by UNICEF and includes members of the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Division, and the World Bank Group."}, {"id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.S2", "text": "Since 2018, UN IGME has been working on estimating stillbirth indicators."}, {"id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.S3", "text": "Stillbirths are a marker of maternal health, as well as access to quality care during pregnancy and around the time of birth."}, {"id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.S4", "text": "Ending preventable stillbirths is among the core goals of the UNs Global Strategy for Womens, Childrens and Adolescents Health11 and the Every Newborn Action Plan.12"}, {"id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.S5", "text": "These global initiatives aim to reduce the stillbirth rate to 12 or fewer third trimester stillbirths per 1,000 total births in every country by 2030."}], "entities": [{"id": "461f17af513cdd050f39d130afbc6ffab0d8518e0863593a12e603fbfa1e6217", "mention_id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.ORG0", "text": "The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "623b2b96c7d64680a894827b72c0a8426a7b0425a760b6219ca89f03d3a11b6b", "mention_id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.ORG2", "text": "UNICEF", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "5d7638d4b74cf48b6ea497aed6c211a63dcacd11ccfbda5c461aa4967938a597", "mention_id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.ORG3", "text": "the World Health Organization", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "0a0dd788b8274effadb402b520a8279542ce650f79f9f2c4355fca34c69b9a1f", "mention_id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.ORG4", "text": "the United Nations Population Division", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "84ad27e260c49fe782216303ada7fc32c62c8e2db55fda33bb0f46d9bfb108ca", "mention_id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.ORG5", "text": "the World Bank Group", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "b667ecccc7b899d413cb1e853c6bd92127d61d85e26170681ccf7afa094c7bf4", "mention_id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.ORG7", "text": "UN IGME", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "2a3dbc415aad7096ffabe3221d2d56e9fc2e804f250e1408ae6c12c84e6cb75c", "mention_id": "787f8200bff5be0b9e3983f2519f15010109bad9e780e46de7db84f723c3a683.PG57.PA3.LAW8", "text": "the Every Newborn Action Plan.12", "label": "LAW"}]}
