Cases are typically coded according to crimes as defined in criminal codes, but information about the age and sex of victims, age and sex of perpetrators, and victim-perpetrator relationships are not regularly compiled from court case files. Another challenge is that criminal law administrators do not typically have a document or legal case management system that allows them to easily extract data related to cases of violence against children, and related prosecutions and convictions. In Morocco, the Ministry of Justice established cells and court units for care and support to children and women. These are responsible for systematically collecting administrative data on prosecutions and court outcomes of cases of violence against children, and compiling and reporting that data on a quarterly and annual basis for national analysis. An annual report on violence against children is published.  Four of the five countries with in-depth assessments revealed numerous examples of how ministries are transitioning from paper-based record-keeping systems to computer-based document or case management systems. The transitions are not without challenges, including in terms of technology and human resources. Many ministries end up with dual recordkeeping systems, which allow staff and supervisors who lack computer skills to continue relying on the paper-based system. This practice limits or delays the ability of all other employees to fully transition to the computer-based document or case management system. Some ministries also rely on Excel to manage and analyse data, though it has limited data analysis capabilities.  Data are not collected on all relevant types of violence against children or with enough specificity to report on different forms. For instance, in Indonesia, there was a tendency across all ministries/agencies and sectors, including the police, to categorize violence against children as physical, sexual, emotional or economic. In Nigeria, the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development recorded orphaned and vulnerable children as simply abandoned or abused. In Uganda, the Ministry of Health recorded data on only four areas related to gender-based violence: injuries, abortions, sexually transmitted infections and anxiety. In Uganda, where defilement of children is a serious problem, agencies did not always distinguish between simple and aggravated defilement, even though these are important distinctions in the criminal code. Some agencies lacked clarity on the different types of violence against children, which can lead to inconsistent identification and registration of cases within agencies, and across agencies and sectors.  Registries and reporting forms do not always allow service providers to record multiple types of violence experienced by victims. Victims may experience more than one type of violence. For instance, a victim of sexual violence may also experience physical and emotional violence. Therefore, service providers need reporting forms that allow them to record all types of violence experienced. If service providers can only record one type, data will be lost and inaccurate.  Across countries, disaggregation of data was often limited to sex and age, and the way age was disaggregated varied significantly. Limited demographic data are captured on victims and perpetrators. In some agencies that rely on paper-based registries, such as police stations, only the names of the victim and perpetrator were likely to be recorded, whereas the sex and age of the victim and perpetrator, and victim-perpetrator relationships, were not routinely recorded.  Paper-based reporting forms and computer-based document management systems are not regularly updated to reflect changes in laws and criminal codes, including categories of crimes. For instance, the Uganda Police Force had not updated their paper-based reporting forms in over a decade. Officers at the district level recorded many forms of violence against children as other because there was no line on the reporting forms for the type of violence.  Staff lack training on how to input data and information on violence against children into paper-based reporting forms or computer-based document and case management systems. In addition to lack of training, attrition of trained staff was a challenge for many agencies.  Very few countries had formal processes to ensure that data on violence against children are accurate, complete and reliable. They also lacked data protection policies and practices to ensure data confidentiality. This was a particular concern in Indonesia and Jamaica, where efforts are under way to link data from many sectors to citizen ID numbers. This includes data on violence against women and children.

The Child Protection Database was supported in part by UNICEF and contains data related to 87 indicators in areas such as child maltreatment, juvenile justice, child protection, health, student support services and children in care. The databases scope was expanded to serve as a central repository for data on child protection, and provides a common avenue for disseminating summary data to all local and international stakeholders. Data on child-specific indicators can be used to inform policy decisions, highlight new or existing areas of concern, and monitor various action plans, including the National Plan of Action for Children. In recent years, however, after the initial memorandum of understanding expired, membership in the technical working group for the database decreased, and there have been few updates to the indicators. Awareness of the database among service providers is low.  Office of the Childrens Registry  The office has a central office in Kingston, from which it operates a national hotline, and four parish offices across the island. Parish offices were determined based on the number of reports from particular areas. The office can receive reports of violence against children and missing children by various means, including telephone, email, fax and walk-ins. When a report of violence comes into the office, an officer enters the information into a reporting form on the computer. The office also keeps a paper-based log book, referred to as the childrens registry, where information on each report is recorded. Data collected typically include the childs age, sex, name and address, as well as the sex of the perpetrator and the reporters information. Once the office receives a report, a case identification number is assigned to each child in the report, and the case is referred to a local service provider, typically the Child Development Agency or Office of the Childrens Advocate, for investigation and intervention. Referrals are usually sent via email. All reports go through the central office in Kingston. When reports are made by walk-ins at the four parish offices, officials must enter the report in the computer-based case management system and send it to the central office for processing. The Office of the Childrens Registry has established practices for checking to see if a report involving the same child has been made more than once. A record-keeping scheme documents the initial report, follow-up reports on the same case, and/or more than one report involving the same child. This has helped to reduce the risk of double counting reports involving the same child. Discussions on merging the Office of the Childrens Registry and the Child Development Agency make sense since the two agencies already work closely, and they complement and support each other. A merger would help to improve referrals and case management in cases of violence against children and missing children.  Office of the Childrens Advocate  The office collects data on the number of reports made to the Childrens Advocate. It represents child victims of physical, sexual and emotional violence, neglect, trafficking and child labour in the court system. The office also works with children with behavioural problems or in need of care and protection.  Ministry of Health  In 2009, the ministry established the Jamaica Injury Surveillance System in hospitals to collect data on injuries, including among children who experience violence. But given staff turnover and a lack of human resources to manage the system, the ministry has struggled to ensure it is used. Efforts are under way to restore the system in eight hospitals, excluding the Kingston Public Hospital.11 Staff members assigned to registration in the hospitals are supposed to enter information in the system when a patient arrives with an injury, but hospitals are still using paper-based recordkeeping and transmitting paper-based data to one central area of the ministry. Based on patient statements, injuries are categorized as motor vehicle-related, violence-related, suicide and/or unintentional. When a child arrives with injuries, the parent or caregiver is questioned as to the reason for them. In the case of violence-related injuries, the person doing the registration should attempt to gather information about the victim-perpetrator relationship and where the violence occurred. The registration forms are then printed and provided to the doctors who are expected to ask follow-up screening questions and manually record the information in each patients medical records. Fear of retaliation from perpetrators and his/her family members, however, means that registration staff members do not regularly complete all questions in the Jamaica Injury Surveillance System, and doctors do not regularly ask follow-up screening questions. It is not clear how often hospitals share system data with the ministry, how data are collated and analysed, or how often reports are generated based on the system data. While some hospitals have proper documentation in the system, others do not.

Fear of retaliation from perpetrators and his/her family members, however, means that registration staff members do not regularly complete all questions in the Jamaica Injury Surveillance System, and doctors do not regularly ask follow-up screening questions.

The ministrys Guidance and Counselling Unit does work with at-risk and vulnerable children, including victims of violence. Information related to children and cases of violence against children is in paper-based case files. The Safe Schools Project is led by a police officer from the Jamaica Constabulary Force who has contact with the forces community safety and security branches and school resource officers. The officer is able to get information and data from the branches about the number and types of incidents of violence in and around schools, and the number of weapons confiscated in schools. There is no such direct line of reporting or data-sharing between the officer and school resource officers, however. School resource officers complete incident reports that they send to the Jamaica Constabulary Forces community safety and security branches, and the branches compile monthly reports for the police division headquarters. Moreover, there is no direct line of communication or data-sharing between the Guidance and Counselling Unit and the Safe Schools Project officer. The latter communicates directly with the chief education officer, who has oversight of the Education Services Division. This limits the ability of the Guidance and Counselling Unit and the safe schools project officer to effectively work together to address and prevent violence against children in and around schools, and to work with child victims and perpetrators.  Ministry of Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sports The Womens Centre of Jamaica Foundation, working under the ministry, offers academic and reintegration programmes for pregnant girls. The Womens Centre has both paperand computer-based document management systems, and typically collects information on girls who experience violence and their perpetrators. This information may be recorded in girls case files, but there is no systematic practice for collecting or collating data on sexual violence or domestic violence, or relationships to perpetrators.

The ministrys Guidance and Counselling Unit does work with at-risk and vulnerable children, including victims of violence. Information related to children and cases of violence against children is in paper-based case files. The Safe Schools Project is led by a police officer from the Jamaica Constabulary Force who has contact with the forces community safety and security branches and school resource officers. The officer is able to get information and data from the branches about the number and types of incidents of violence in and around schools, and the number of weapons confiscated in schools. There is no such direct line of reporting or data-sharing between the officer and school resource officers, however. School resource officers complete incident reports that they send to the Jamaica Constabulary Forces community safety and security branches, and the branches compile monthly reports for the police division headquarters. Moreover, there is no direct line of communication or data-sharing between the Guidance and Counselling Unit and the Safe Schools Project officer. The latter communicates directly with the chief education officer, who has oversight of the Education Services Division.

At the district level, there are relatively few social workers and probation officers working with vulnerable children, including child victims of violence and children in conflict with the law. District action centres connect district probation officers and social workers to the Uganda Child Helpline, enabling them to receive referrals from the helpline and access the online computer-based case management system. The centres were established in 33 districts as of June 2017. District probation officers and social workers are responsible for referring child victims of violence and their families to needed services in the community, as well as working with orphans and vulnerable children. They often record information on orphaned and vulnerable children and other vulnerable children in registry books, as well as in the Orphaned and Vulnerable Children Management Information System.  National Gender-based Violence Database  The database, which is under the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, is a government initiative that enables actors in Uganda who are responding to genderbased violence to safely collect, store and generate reports in real time. The database covers 83 of 117 districts in Uganda. The database provides summary data on incidents of gender-based violence by district and region, including types of violence, perpetrator data and victim data. The database was developed to support a collaborative, multifunctional, inter-agency and community-based approach to gender-based violence. It is not a case management system, however, but more of a database that allows the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development to monitor reported incidents, which can facilitate evidence-based decision-making. One challenge is that the Uganda Police Force does not input incidents into the National Gender-based Violence Database, although officers have been trained to do so.  Orphaned and Vulnerable Children Management Information System  Managed by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, the system measures progress towards achieving the National Strategic Programme Plan of Interventions for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children.

Adults often call on behalf of children, but children call the helpline as well. Calls can come from any location in the country. Some callers are reporting cases of violence against children, which may be critical and need immediate intervention by service providers (for example, in the case of child defilement, child marriage and physical violence), while others are less critical. With support from UNICEF, the helpline is able to operate 24 hours a day, every day. Helpline staff also accept walk-in cases, review the Uganda Police Force reports for cases of violence against children, monitor media (including social media) for reports of cases, and organize community awareness-raising campaigns and school visits. An officer from the Uganda Police Forces Child and Family Protection Department has been assigned to the helpline. This assignment has significantly improved the ability of staff to collaborate more effectively with both the police and Child and Family Protection Units across the country to ensure they are taking the steps and actions needed in cases handled and supported by the helpline and district probation and social workers.", "sentences": [{"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S0", "text": "The system has four modules: Local Government Capacity for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programme Module; OVC Service Provision and Utilization Module; OVC Household Need Modules; and Children/Babies Home Module."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S1", "text": "Each module includes a data collection tool and detailed data elements collected using the tool."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S2", "text": "The accuracy of data has been an issue because the system is not for case management, and service providers are not able to determine which services their clients are accessing or when."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S3", "text": "The system does not provide information or data on the quality of services."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S5", "text": "The helpline is an important service and medium through which childrens voices can be heard and relevant responses given to child protection issues."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S6", "text": "Adults often call on behalf of children, but children call the helpline as well."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S7", "text": "Calls can come from any location in the country."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S8", "text": "Some callers are reporting cases of violence against children, which may be critical and need immediate intervention by service providers, while others are less critical."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S9", "text": "With support from UNICEF, the helpline is able to operate 24 hours a day, every day."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S10", "text": "Helpline staff also accept walk-in cases, review the Uganda Police Force reports for cases of violence against children, monitor media for reports of cases, and organize community awareness-raising campaigns and school visits."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S11", "text": "An officer from the Uganda Police Forces Child and Family Protection Department has been assigned to the helpline."}, {"id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.S12", "text": "This assignment has significantly improved the ability of staff to collaborate more effectively with both the police and Child and Family Protection Units across the country to ensure they are taking the steps and actions needed in cases handled and supported by the helpline and district probation and social workers."}], "entities": [{"id": "b48520e835d4707e9c876a80c540cda194ee090b45bdbad23ba8d378b7fea30f", "mention_id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.ORG1", "text": "Uganda Child Helpline", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "623b2b96c7d64680a894827b72c0a8426a7b0425a760b6219ca89f03d3a11b6b", "mention_id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.ORG2", "text": "UNICEF", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "77eb17712b3eab2132e577673e9564c8463fd5ad1fd0063d356d0aecedbec946", "mention_id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.ORG5", "text": "Uganda Police Force", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "fa4f14cd5304627e5569a1330178347f50e17831a19ee8ab3fec984646fc66f7", "mention_id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.ORG6", "text": "the Uganda Police Forces Child and Family Protection Department", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "1229c881e41706fb1e20d2d4fc94d6cbe88a1b27dea9d26e78c260b48efb1810", "mention_id": "ac1f793d635e84debb7631c577b00edfca2b3c3c2d2cbe79236aa258d80a8241.PG62.PA2.ORG7", "text": "Child and Family Protection Units", "label": "ORG"}]}
