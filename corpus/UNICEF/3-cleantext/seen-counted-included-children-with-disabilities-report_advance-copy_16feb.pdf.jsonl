In this pooled dataset, weights were maintained for country-level analyses. First, a single stratum indicator was generated to reflect the complete multi-frame design and ensure that each stratum and primary sample unit assumed a unique value across countries. Next, population scaling was carried out to recalibrate the country-specific weights, adjusting for country population size relative to sample sizes. The child population in Punjab and Sindh regions represents around 75 per cent of the total population of children in Pakistan, and therefore data from these two surveys were considered to be representative at the country level.
