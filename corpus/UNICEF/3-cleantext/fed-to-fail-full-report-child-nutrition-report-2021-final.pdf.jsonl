But so many children do not have access to nutritious and safe foods during the time in their lives when good nutrition matters most. The consequences of poor diets hit young children the hardest. That is because delays in growth and development occur mostly during the first two years of life, often because of inadequate nutrition. Without nutritious diets, supportive nutrition services and good feeding practices during this critical period, children under two are at heightened risk of all forms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, micronutrient deficiencies, being overweight and obesity. This global report  Fed to Fail?  sounds the alarm on the crisis of childrens diets during the critical developmental period between six months, when children begin eating their first solid foods, and 2 years of age. It presents the most recent UNICEF data and evidence that shows the alarming state of childrens diets globally and the inequities affecting the youngest and most marginalized children. The report makes clear that the world has failed to truly improve the way that most young children are fed in early life.", "sentences": [{"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S0", "text": "The challenges they face are wide-ranging: parents living in poverty may not be able to afford quality food; those living in hard-to-reach communities or areas affected by conflict or climate change may not have access to fresh fruits and vegetables; meanwhile many markets are flooded with low-cost baby food that is high in sugar and over-processed."}, {"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S1", "text": "The drivers of poor diets for the worlds youngest children  inequality, globalization, urbanization, conflict, the socioeconomic costs of the COVID-19 pandemic  lie beyond the control of individual families, yet families are largely left alone to bear the consequences."}, {"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S2", "text": "We know that what and how children are fed before 2 years of age shapes their growth, development, and learning  all of which will set the course for the rest of their lives."}, {"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S3", "text": "But so many children do not have access to nutritious and safe foods during the time in their lives when good nutrition matters most."}, {"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S4", "text": "The consequences of poor diets hit young children the hardest."}, {"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S5", "text": "That is because delays in growth and development occur mostly during the first two years of life, often because of inadequate nutrition."}, {"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S6", "text": "Without nutritious diets, supportive nutrition services and good feeding practices during this critical period, children under two are at heightened risk of all forms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, micronutrient deficiencies, being overweight and obesity."}, {"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S7", "text": "This global report  Fed to Fail?  sounds the alarm on the crisis of childrens diets during the critical developmental period between six months, when children begin eating their first solid foods, and 2 years of age."}, {"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S8", "text": "It presents the most recent UNICEF data and evidence that shows the alarming state of childrens diets globally and the inequities affecting the youngest and most marginalized children."}, {"id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.S9", "text": "The report makes clear that the world has failed to truly improve the way that most young children are fed in early life."}], "entities": [{"id": "64f9a6dadc986aa372fd0d3c5836b3ae991d402e52b981fb8c43479496187dd2", "mention_id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.WORK_OF_ART3", "text": "Fed to Fail", "label": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"id": "623b2b96c7d64680a894827b72c0a8426a7b0425a760b6219ca89f03d3a11b6b", "mention_id": "ca853c79eeb766bc8a62e3b1696cb0237dc12f81a92eda38ffd485c22754faec.PG6.PA4.ORG7", "text": "UNICEF", "label": "ORG"}]}

First a global population-weighted stunting prevalence estimate for children under 2 years of age and for children 2 to 4 years of age was calculated for each age group using survey-based data as per description of analysis for Figure 4. ii. Using the resulting stunting prevalence estimates for children under 2 years of age and children 2 to 4 years of age, the number of affected children in each sub-age group was calculated using the populations for each one-year age grouping. Next, the number of stunted children under 2 years of age was divided by the number of stunted children aged 04 years to obtain the proportion of children with stunting who were under 2 years of age.
