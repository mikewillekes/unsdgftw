Global coverage of basic hygiene services in schools had increased by 1 percentage point per year since 2015. Achieving universal access by 2030 would require a four-fold increase in the current rate of progress.  Coverage of basic hygiene services in schools ranged from 17% in Oceania to 100% in Australia and New Zealand.  58% of secondary schools and 56% of primary schools had a basic hygiene service. There were insufficient data to calculate global estimates for pre-primary schools.  34% of rural schools had a basic hygiene service and 41% had no hygiene service. There were insufficient data to calculate global estimates for urban schools.  40% of children whose schools still had no hygiene service lived in Least Developed Countries.

The 2018 school infrastructure diagnostic in Burundi showed that just 24% of pre-primary, primary and secondary schools had a permanent year-round water supply, 18% had seasonal or irregular supplies, 14% had supplies that were currently or sometimes broken down, and nearly half (44%) had no water source at all (Figure 26). Even if water is available, it may not be sufficient to meet all of the schools needs. For example, the 2018 Annual Education Statistics for Bhutan show that while 82% of schools had sufficient water for handwashing and 79% had sufficient water for drinking, only 66% had sufficient water for cleaning toilets and 58% had sufficient water for bathing (Figure 27).", "sentences": [{"id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.S0", "text": "If schools do not have access to water supplies on premises, drinking water must either be collected or delivered from sources located elsewhere."}, {"id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.S1", "text": "The 2017 South Sudan Education Cluster Assessment found that students and staff at nearly half of primary schools in rural areas spent more than 10 minutes per trip to collect drinking water, compared with fewer than a third in urban areas."}, {"id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.S2", "text": "This means that in one out of five schools in South Sudan students and staff spent over 30 minutes per roundtrip to collect water from sources located off premises."}, {"id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.S3", "text": "Availability throughout the year is also a challenge in many countries."}, {"id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.S4", "text": "The 2018 school infrastructure diagnostic in Burundi showed that just 24% of pre-primary, primary and secondary schools had a permanent year-round water supply, 18% had seasonal or irregular supplies, 14% had supplies that were currently or sometimes broken down, and nearly half had no water source at all."}, {"id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.S5", "text": "Even if water is available, it may not be sufficient to meet all of the schools needs."}, {"id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.S6", "text": "For example, the 2018 Annual Education Statistics for Bhutan show that while 82% of schools had sufficient water for handwashing and 79% had sufficient water for drinking, only 66% had sufficient water for cleaning toilets and 58% had sufficient water for bathing."}], "entities": [{"id": "ddea6abd2ee5d012fb6a25e94049b8d15666bc21a49d499a3a96350a1f7d6a8d", "mention_id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.GPE6", "text": "South Sudan", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "ed13ad9a5761b23416495d63e79a46290c43a0f1eba7c8f3d42bd53266a8b2a8", "mention_id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.GPE10", "text": "Burundi", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "0998a4372826dcea9b897fb9704c66a6e6d3a47c4fa5edf2d7fb81705d4bd539", "mention_id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.WORK_OF_ART17", "text": "Annual Education Statistics", "label": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"id": "65a4745d1eaaa35c0ad9d337aa9283064fcbf2f6e0bd9bcd68a0711ce580b4c5", "mention_id": "27c012132229e19626400988449f97937ce89a427dd16798eac64ab7721111ae.PG23.PA5.GPE18", "text": "Bhutan", "label": "GPE"}]}
