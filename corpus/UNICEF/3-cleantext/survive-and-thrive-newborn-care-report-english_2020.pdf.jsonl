Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including universal health coverage, by 2030 requires action now to provide care for all small and sick newborns.  Surviving: More than 2.5 million newborns  mostly those born small or sick  died in 2017 from preventable causes, most notably prematurity, complications around the time of birth, infections and congenital conditions. Some died because the care they received was of poor quality, others because they received no health care at all. To meet the SDG 3.2 target for newborn and child survival, countries need to transform special and intensive care in hospitals.  Thriving: Every year, 30 million newborns require quality special or intensive newborn care in a hospital setting. These newborns can and will survive and thrive as productive members of our societies, provided they are given high-quality inpatient care at the right time and in the right place, including follow-up care and family-centred care.  Transforming: Cost effective solutions exist for the main causes of newborn death and disability. To achieve UHC, there must be innovation through people-centred care, locally-designed technologies, financial protection, and parent power and partnership.

Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including universal health coverage (UHC), by 2030 requires action now to provide care for all small and sick newborns.  Surviving: More than 2.5 million newborns  mostly those born small or sick  died in 2017 from preventable causes, most notably prematurity, complications around the time of birth, infections and congenital conditions. Some died because the care they received was of poor quality, others because they received no health care at all. To meet the SDG 3.2 target for newborn and child survival, countries need to transform special and intensive care in hospitals.  Thriving: Every year, 30 million newborns require quality special or intensive newborn care in a hospital setting.

Engaging parents and families in this way can provide the following benefits: boost parentnewborn attachment; ensure higher breastfeeding rates; facilitate earlier discharge; improve long-term neurodevelopment; encourage reciprocal, cuebased interactions; promote developmentally supportive care; and improve health-related knowledge and beliefs among parents and communities.
