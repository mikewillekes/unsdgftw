In 2018, a survey was carried out to look at the needs of the 99 per cent of forcibly displaced who are dispersed throughout the country. The results show a dramatic disparity between refugees and the rest of the population, as shown in Figure 17. Only 28 per cent of refugees had access to basic sanitation, and as many as 55 per cent of refugee households practiced open defecation.34 These figures are in stark contrast to JMP figures for Afghanistan, which estimate that 43 per cent of the overall population had access to basic sanitation in 2017.35 Even in rural areas, only 17 per cent of households practiced open defecation.", "sentences": [{"id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.S1", "text": "At the end of 2018, there were over 2.7 million forcibly displaced persons in Afghanistan.33"}, {"id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.S2", "text": "There is only one managed camp in Afghanistan, which hosts less than 1 per cent of the forcibly displaced living in the country."}, {"id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.S3", "text": "In 2018, a survey was carried out to look at the needs of the 99 per cent of forcibly displaced who are dispersed throughout the country."}, {"id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.S4", "text": "The results show a dramatic disparity between refugees and the rest of the population, as shown in Figure 17."}, {"id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.S5", "text": "Only 28 per cent of refugees had access to basic sanitation, and as many as 55 per cent of refugee households practiced open defecation.34"}, {"id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.S6", "text": "These figures are in stark contrast to JMP figures for Afghanistan, which estimate that 43 per cent of the overall population had access to basic sanitation in 2017.35"}, {"id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.S7", "text": "Even in rural areas, only 17 per cent of households practiced open defecation."}], "entities": [{"id": "f04ad4d28e19a211cd1f2b39d818ec7a4836245959321767defb45acda361811", "mention_id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.GPE3", "text": "Afghanistan", "label": "GPE"}, {"id": "5ff7c3e87f1aef3410d3cb6bcc14f037bd49ac8c8ac931ab0a0e7ad7917f4e4b", "mention_id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.ORG10", "text": "JMP", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "f04ad4d28e19a211cd1f2b39d818ec7a4836245959321767defb45acda361811", "mention_id": "8668f1bd2237be79dac23d6c9b9db3a3c89f3b8b105e4728a425455da052f00c.PG25.PA2.GPE11", "text": "Afghanistan", "label": "GPE"}]}
