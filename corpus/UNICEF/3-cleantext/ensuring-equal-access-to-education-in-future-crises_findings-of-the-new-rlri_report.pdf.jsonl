The country turned to this critical online learning platform to keep children from pre-primary through to Grade 12 learning during school closures but has found additional uses, including for teacher professional development and for pre-primary learners. The Government also shared lifesaving COVID-19 prevention messages through the platform. Next steps include a formal launch planned for September 2021. Although still in the pilot phase, the platform had approximately 20,000 registered users as of June 2021. UNICEF has contributed an estimated US $700,000 for the launch of the digital learning platform, including translation of international resources and purchase of tablets.
