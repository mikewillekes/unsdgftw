There are countries such as Togo where children start out at a very low level of reading skills in Grade 3, in this instance only 6 per cent of children have foundational reading skills, but then they catch up by Grade 8 to where 70 per cent of children have these skills, displaying a rather steep learning trajectory. Chad provides an example of a country with a fairly steep learning curve for foundational numeracy skills. In Grade 3 only 9 per cent of children have these skills, but by Grade 8 the share of children with foundational numeracy skills has risen to 63 per cent. It is important to consider, however, that some of this increase may be driven by low performers dropping out at the end of primary school. In other countries such as Belarus, where the level of learning starts out relatively high in Grade 3, the progression is more modest because most foundational learning takes place in earlier grades.
