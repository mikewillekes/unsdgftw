In particular, newly accessible data enabled the revision of the entire series of annual undernourishment estimates for China back to 2000, resulting in a substantial downward shift of the series of the number of undernourished in the world. Nevertheless, the revision confirms the trend reported in past editions: the number of people affected by hunger globally has been slowly on the rise since 2014. e Current estimates are that nearly 690 million people are hungry, or 8.9 percent of the world population  up by 10 million people in one year and by nearly 60 million in five years. The number of people affected by severe food insecurity, which is another measure that approximates hunger, shows a similar upward trend. In 2019, close to 750 million  or nearly one in ten people in the world  were exposed to severe levels of food insecurity. e Considering the total affected by moderate or severe food insecurity, an estimated 2 billion people in the world did not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food in 2019. e The world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. If recent trends continue, the number of people affected by hunger would surpass 840 million by 2030. e A preliminary assessment suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic may add between 83 and 132 million people to the total number of undernourished in the world in 2020 depending on the economic growth scenario. e Globally, the burden of malnutrition in all its forms remains a challenge. According to current estimates, in 2019, 21.3 percent of children under 5 years of age were stunted, 6.9 percent wasted and 5.6 percent overweight. e The world is making progress but is not on track to achieve the 2025 and 2030 targets for child stunting and low birthweight, and for exclusive breastfeeding, is on track only for the 2025 target. The prevalence of wasting is notably above the targets. Most regions are not on track to achieve the targets for child overweight. Adult obesity is on the rise in all regions. Urgent action is needed to reverse these upward trends. e The nutritional status of the most vulnerable population groups is likely to deteriorate further due to the health and socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. e Food insecurity can worsen diet quality and consequently increase the risk of various forms of malnutrition, potentially leading to undernutrition as well as overweight and obesity. e Low-income countries rely more on staple foods and less on fruits and vegetables and animal source foods than high-income countries. Only in Asia, and globally in upper-middle-income countries, are there enough fruits and vegetables available for human consumption to be able to meet the FAO/WHO recommendation of consuming a minimum of 400 g/person/day. e While we still face significant challenges in just accessing food, challenges are even more important in terms of accessing healthy diets. | xvi | e Healthy diets are unaffordable to many people, especially the poor, in every region of the world. The most conservative estimate shows they are unaffordable for more than 3 billion people in the world. Healthy diets are estimated to be, on average, five times more expensive than diets that meet only dietary energy needs through a starchy staple. e The cost of a healthy diet exceeds the international poverty line (established at USD 1.90 purchasing power parity per person per day), making it unaffordable for the poor. The cost also exceeds average food expenditures in most countries in the Global South: around 57 percent or more of the population cannot afford a healthy diet throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. e All diets have hidden costs, which must be understood to identify trade-offs and synergies in relation to other SDGs. Two hidden costs that are most critical relate to the health and climate-related consequences of our dietary choices and the food systems that support these. e Under current food consumption patterns, diet-related health costs linked to mortality and non-communicable diseases are projected to exceed USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2030.

The availability of dietary energy per person has increased globally over the past two decades. However, this has not translated into an increase in the availability of nutritious foods that contribute to healthy diets. There are large discrepancies in the per capita availability of foods from different food groups across countries of different income levels. Low-income countries rely more on staple foods and less on fruits and vegetables and animal source foods than high-income countries.

However, considering only the cost and affordability of different diets fails to account for the hidden costs associated with food production and consumption. e All diets around the world, from those that meet only dietary energy needs to those that are considered nutrient adequate and healthy diets, have hidden costs that must be understood in order to identify trade-offs and synergies that affect the achievement of other SDGs. e Two hidden costs of our dietary patterns and of the food systems supporting them relate to the health-related costs for many people and the climate-related costs that the world as a whole incurs. e The first hidden cost: If current food consumption patterns continue, diet-related health costs linked to non-communicable diseases and their mortality are projected to exceed USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2030. On the other hand, shifting to healthy diets would lead to an estimated reduction of up to 97 percent in direct and indirect health costs, thus creating significant savings that could be invested now to lower the cost of nutritious foods. e The second hidden cost: The diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions associated with current dietary patterns is projected to exceed USD 1.7 trillion per year by 2030.

However, considering only the cost and affordability of different diets fails to account for the hidden costs associated with food production and consumption. e All diets around the world, from those that meet only dietary energy needs to those that are considered nutrient adequate and healthy diets, have hidden costs that must be understood in order to identify trade-offs and synergies that affect the achievement of other SDGs. e Two hidden costs of our dietary patterns and of the food systems supporting them relate to the health-related costs for many people (SDG 3) and the climate-related costs that the world as a whole incurs (SDG 13). e The first hidden cost: If current food consumption patterns continue, diet-related health costs linked to non-communicable diseases and their mortality are projected to exceed USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2030. On the other hand, shifting to healthy diets would lead to an estimated reduction of up to 97 percent in direct and indirect health costs, thus creating significant savings that could be invested now to lower the cost of nutritious foods. e The second hidden cost: The diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with current dietary patterns is projected to exceed USD 1.7 trillion per year by 2030. The adoption of healthy diets that include sustainability considerations would reduce the social cost of GHG emissions by an estimated 4174 percent in 2030. e Not accounting for the hidden costs of diets would result in a serious cost underestimation of achieving food security and nutrition, and ignore the challenges of achieving environmental sustainability and health for all. e Shifting to healthy diets that include sustainability considerations could help to reduce health and climate-change costs by 2030, as their hidden costs are lower compared with those of current food consumption patterns.

Due to data limitations, the indirect costs included in the analysis presented in this report only relate to the loss of productivity/working days, and the costs of informal care.", "sentences": [{"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG128.PA6.S0", "text": "Despite these challenges, valuating the health impacts of diet-related diseases, specif ically NCDs, provides a useful indication of the level of impacts."}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG128.PA6.S1", "text": "This report provides a comparative analysis of the health benefits of global dietary changes for all major regions in the world and by country income group."}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG128.PA6.S2", "text": "The analysis of hidden costs or externalities related to the health impact of diets combines two parameters: the estimated number of deaths due to four specific NCDs, and the estimated health costs associated with those NCDs."}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG128.PA6.S3", "text": "Due to data limitations, the indirect costs included in the analysis presented in this report only relate to the loss of productivity/working days, and the costs of informal care."}], "entities": []}

Through retail engagement activities, the following lessons were learned to help improve value chains and access to healthy diets:  Directly linking small retailers to wholesalers and manufacturers helps increase availability and affordability of nutritious foods. This is because when intermediaries are cut from the value chain, the mark-ups on commodities decrease and the savings can be passed on directly to the customer.  Access to credit for small retailers is critical to improving the supply of goods, because small retailers often cannot afford to buy in bulk or to pay suppliers up front.

Cost and affordability are shown by region, development status and population in year 2017. The cost of the three diets is based on retail food price data obtained from the World Banks International Comparison Program for internationally standardized items, converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity. Two measures of affordability are presented. One shows the cost of each diet as a percentage of average food expenditure per capita per day in a given country: each diet is unaffordable for values greater than 100 percent.

Cost and affordability are shown by region (column 2), development status (column 3) and population in year 2017 (column 4). The cost of the three diets is based on retail food price data obtained from the World Banks International Comparison Program (ICP) for internationally standardized items, converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP). Two measures of affordability are presented. One shows the cost of each diet as a percentage of average food expenditure per capita per day in a given country (columns 6, 9 and 12): each diet is unaffordable for values greater than 100 percent. The other measure shows the percentage of people who cannot afford the three reference diets: each diet is unaffordable when its cost exceeds the 63 percent of the average income in a given country (columns 7, 10 and 13).

Global, regional and country income group averages are presented in Table 7. This measure of affordability compares the cost of each diet with the average estimated income in a given country, under the assumption that 63 percent of the income available can be credibly reserved for food. A diet is considered unaffordable when its cost exceeds the 63 percent of the average income in a given country.

On average, 16.5 percent of avoided deaths in 2030 are due to diet-related risk factors, and 7.7 percent to weight-related risk factors. The remaining percent of deaths are attr ibuted to non-dietary risks that are not accounted for in this analysis.67 This differentiation by risk factor shows that the majority of avoidable deaths, on average 68 percent, were due to imbalances in dietary composition, as opposed to weight-related risk factors. These imbalances included too-low average consumption of whole grains (6.7 percent), fruits (2.2 percent), vegetables (2.4 percent), legumes (2.5 percent), nuts (2 percent), and too-high consumption of red meat (2.4 percent) and processed meat bd See footnote y. (2.4 percent). The remaining 32 percent of the avoided deaths were due to imbalanced weight levels, including underweight (0.5 percent), overweight (2.3 percent) and obesity (4.8 percent) (see Annex 8, Table A8.1, last column).", "sentences": [{"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG277.PA1.S0", "text": "HEALTH AND CLIMATE-CHANGE COSTS RELATED TO DIETARY RISKS A."}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG277.PA1.S1", "text": "Additional figures on hidden health costs Figure 32 shows the number of deaths avoided in year 2030 when moving from the benchmark diet to the four alternative healthy diet patternsbd that include sustainability considerations."}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG277.PA1.S2", "text": "Furthermore, it is important to see the contribution of weight-related and diet-related risk factors to the total avoided deaths."}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG277.PA1.S3", "text": "Table A8.1 shows imbalance in the consumption of food groups and imbalances in weight levels associated to deaths that could be avoided in 2030 by moving from the benchmark scenario to the adoption of the four alternative healthy diet patterns."}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG277.PA1.S4", "text": "On average, 16.5 percent of avoided deaths in 2030 are due to diet-related risk factors, and 7.7 percent to weight-related risk factors."}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG277.PA1.S5", "text": "The remaining percent of deaths are attr ibuted to non-dietary risks that are not accounted for in this analysis.67"}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG277.PA1.S6", "text": "This differentiation by risk factor shows that the majority of avoidable deaths, on average 68 percent, were due to imbalances in dietary composition, as opposed to weight-related risk factors."}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG277.PA1.S7", "text": "These imbalances included too-low average consumption of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and too-high consumption of red meat and processed meat bd"}, {"id": "0c333e2a4647edfd29c178d7618a5fe248854ac8886e2e92e101df4e1bb604c2.PG277.PA1.S9", "text": "The remaining 32 percent of the avoided deaths were due to imbalanced weight levels, including underweight, overweight and obesity."}], "entities": []}
