Now, the pandemic has made this significantly more challenging. This report presents the first global assessment of food insecurity and malnutrition for 2020 and highlights the need for a deeper reflection on how to better address the global food security and nutrition situation. e World hunger increased in 2020 under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. After remaining virtually unchanged for five years, the prevalence of undernourishment increased 1.5 percentage points in just one year  reaching a level of around 9.9 percent, heightening the challenge of achieving the Zero Hunger target by 2030. e It is projected that between 720 and 811 million people in the world faced hunger in 2020. Considering the middle of the projected range, around 118 million more people were facing hunger in 2020 than in 2019  or as many as 161 million more, considering the upper bound of the range. e More than half of the worlds undernourished are found in Asia and more than one-third in Africa. Compared with 2019, about 46 million more people in Africa, 57 million more in Asia, and about 14 million more in Latin America and the Caribbean were affected by hunger in 2020. e New projections confirm that hunger will not be eradicated by 2030 unless bold actions are taken to accelerate progress, especially actions to address inequality in access to food. All other things constant, around 660 million people may still face hunger in 2030 in part due to lasting effects of the pandemic on global food security  30 million more people than in a scenario in which the pandemic had not occurred. e While the global prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity has been slowly on the rise since 2014, the estimated increase in 2020 was equal to that of the previous five years combined. Nearly one in three people in the world did not have access to adequate food in 2020  an increase of almost 320 million people in just one year. e Close to 12 percent of the global population was severely food insecure in 2020, representing 928 million people  148 million more than in 2019. e At the global level, the gender gap in the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity has grown even larger in the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity being 10 percent higher among women than men in 2020, compared to 6 percent in 2019. e The high cost of healthy diets coupled with persistent high levels of income inequality put healthy diets out of reach for around 3 billion people, especially the poor, in every region of the world in 2019. This number is slightly less than in 2017 and will likely increase in most regions in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. e Shifting to healthy diets that include sustainability considerations can contribute to reducing health and climate change costs by 2030, because the hidden costs of these diets are lower compared with those of current consumption patterns. e Globally, malnutrition in all its forms also remains a challenge. Although, it is not yet possible to fully account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to data limitations, in 2020 it is estimated that 22.0 percent of children under 5 years of age were affected by stunting, 6.7 percent were suffering from wasting and 5.7 percent were overweight. The actual figures, particularly for stunting and wasting, are expected to be higher due to the effects of the pandemic. | xii | e Most children with malnutrition live in Africa and Asia. These regions account for more than nine out of ten of all children with stunting, more than nine out of ten children with wasting and more than seven out of ten children who are affected by overweight worldwide. e An estimated 29.9 percent of women aged 15 to 49 years in 2019 around the world are affected by anaemia  now a Sustainable Development Goal Indicator. However, the data reveal stark regional differences: more than 30 percent of women in Africa and Asia were affected by anaemia, compared with only 14.6 percent of women in Northern America and Europe. Adult obesity is increasing sharply in all regions. e Globally, the world is not on track to achieve targets for any of the nutrition indicators by 2030. The current rate of progress on child stunting, exclusive breastfeeding and low birthweight is insufficient, and progress on child overweight, child wasting, anaemia in women of reproductive age and adult obesity is stalled or the situation is worsening. e The COVID-19 pandemic has likely impacted the prevalence of multiple forms of malnutrition, and could have lasting effects beyond 2020, as we are already seeing in 2021. These will be compounded through the intergenerational effects of malnutrition and the resulting impacts on productivity. Exceptional efforts are required to address and overcome the effects of the pandemic as part of accelerating progress towards achieving SDG Target 2.2. e Conflict, climate variability and extremes, and economic slowdowns and downturns are major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition that continue to increase in both frequency and intensity, and are occurring more frequently in combination. e The reversal in the PoU trends in 2014 and continuous increase, especially pronounced in lowand middle-income countries from 2017, are largely attributed to countries affected by conflict, climate extremes and economic downturns, and to countries with high income inequality. e Between 2017 and 2019, the PoU increased by 4 percent in countries affected by one or more of these major drivers while it decreased by 3 percent in countries not affected by them. While middle-income countries affected by these drivers registered only a 2 percent increase in the PoU, the increase for those with high income inequality was double  4 percent. e In the same period, countries affected by multiple drivers exhibited the highest increases in the PoU, 12 times larger than those in countries affected by only a single driver. e Drivers that are external and internal to food systems are pushing up the cost of nutritious foods which, combined with low incomes, are increasing the unaffordability of healthy diets. The percentage of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet in countries affected by multiple drivers in 2019 was 39 percent and 66 percent higher, respectively, than in countries affected by a single driver or no driver at all. Increases in the unaffordability of a healthy diet are associated with higher levels of food insecurity, especially among lower-middle-income countries. e In 2020, almost all lowand middle-income countries were affected by pandemic-induced economic downturns, and the increase in their number of undernourished was more than five times greater than the highest increase in undernourishment in the last two decades. When those countries were also affected by other drivers, particularly climate-related disasters, conflict, or a combination, the largest increase in undernourishment was seen in Africa, followed by Asia. | xiii |", "raw_text": "KEY MESSAGES e Well before the COVID-19 pandemic, we were already not on track to meet our commitments to end world hunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030.

However, recognizing that reliance on three-year moving averages would very likely underestimate the actual change in CV|y from 2019 to 2020, the 2020 nowcast was instead based on the change estimated by considering the actual, unsmoothed change in the prevalence of severe food insecurity from 2019 to 2020. In addition, recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic has created additional constraints that may have exacerbated an overall inequality in the ability of people to access food, an additional component was considered in the estimates of the total CV of the distribution of dietary energy consumption in 2020 that is independent of both monetary incomes and dietary energy requirements. In practice, the range of values for the nowcast 2020 CV|y is obtained by parametrically varying the contribution of the change in CV to the change in PoU estimates from one-third, which provides the lower bound, to 100 percent of the observed change in severe food insecurity, which provides the upper bound.

This makes it difficult to generate reliable trends over time with the input data available and, as such, this report provides only the most recent global and regional estimates. 2 For wasting and exclusive breastfeeding, estimates are not shown for regions/years where population coverage was below 50 percent. 3 The collection of household survey data on child height and weight were limited in 2020 due to the physical distancing measures required to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Only four national surveys included in the database were carried out in 2020. The estimates on child stunting, wasting and overweight are therefore based almost entirely on data collected before 2020 and do not take into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 For methods on projections to 2025 and 2030, see Annex 2. 5 For wasting and low birthweight, the Asia estimate excludes Japan.

This makes it difficult to generate reliable trends over time with the input data available and, as such, this report provides only the most recent global and regional estimates. 2 For wasting and exclusive breastfeeding, estimates are not shown for regions/years where population coverage was below 50 percent. 3 The collection of household survey data on child height and weight were limited in 2020 due to the physical distancing measures required to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Only four national surveys included in the database were carried out (at least partially) in 2020. The estimates on child stunting, wasting and overweight are therefore based almost entirely on data collected before 2020 and do not take into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 For methods on projections to 2025 and 2030, see Annex 2. 5 For wasting and low birthweight, the Asia estimate excludes Japan.

Key messages include:  Systemic, inclusive approaches to food systems strengthen the links between the environment, health and food production. This includes a biocentric approach that uses new metrics to measure system performance to complement current indicators. Internationally, the One Health approach recognizes the interdependence between food, health and the environment, including biodiversity.228  Diversification of the food base. Indigenous Peoples food systems can serve as an example of how to expand current food bases in acknowledging biodiversity, enabling diverse agri-food systems, building resilience and ensuring positive human health benefits from diversified diets.283 The Tikuna, Cocama and Yagua Peoples in Colombia as well as Khasi, Botia and Anwal Peoples in India sustain food systems counting well beyond 100 edibles consisting of wild, semi-domesticated and domesticated species.112 And the Tzeltal women in Mexico conserve the biological richness of maize, validating sustainable practices and doubling the productivity of their seeds.

Timely availability of data and information at both national and subnational levels will also be critical to monitor progress towards targets and to target interventions where they are needed most. As presented in this report (Chapter 2), having food security estimates based on the Food Experience Scale at disaggregated geographical level has allowed policymakers and programme planners to visualize which provinces or regions are most in need of interventions to guarantee the right to adequate food. Moreover, more and better data allow for carrying out situation analyses covering context-specific and comprehensive assessments of which key drivers are impacting negatively on food systems and resulting in poor food security and nutrition outcomes (as noted in Chapter 4).", "sentences": [{"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG150.PA4.S0", "text": "As with all systemic changes, the actions taken along the six transformation pathways proposed in this report will result in winners and losers."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG150.PA4.S1", "text": "The introduction of new technologies and innovations will serve as important accelerators in the comprehensive portfolios of policies, investments and legislation aimed at transforming food systems to increase the affordability of healthy diets."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG150.PA4.S2", "text": "However, adequate governance will need to be in place to ensure no one is left behind in the access to these accelerations and potential inequalities and divides are prevented."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG150.PA4.S3", "text": "Timely availability of data and information at both national and subnational levels will also be critical to monitor progress towards targets and to target interventions where they are needed most."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG150.PA4.S4", "text": "As presented in this report, having food security estimates based on the Food Experience Scale at disaggregated geographical level has allowed policymakers and programme planners to visualize which provinces or regions are most in need of interventions to guarantee the right to adequate food."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG150.PA4.S5", "text": "Moreover, more and better data allow for carrying out situation analyses covering context-specific and comprehensive assessments of which key drivers are impacting negatively on food systems and resulting in poor food security and nutrition outcomes."}], "entities": []}

For the four indicators of child stunting, child overweight, child wasting, and anaemia among women, there are three off track sub-categories: off track  some progress (yellow), off track  no progress (light red) and off track  worsening (dark red). For low birthweight and exclusive breastfeeding, the categories of off track  no progress (light red) and off track  worsening (dark red) are combined into one category of off track  no progress or worsening which is represented with an orange colour because there is insufficient bb See technical note on how to calculate AARR at: https://data. unicef.org/resources/technical-note-calculate-average-annual-ratereduction-aarr-underweight-prevalence variation in the progress to date to use the two categories for these indicators. For adult obesity, since the target is no increase, for which the required AARR is  0, it is not possible to have a category of off track  some progress (yellow) or off track  no progress (light red) and therefore only off track  worsening (dark red) is used.  Assessment not possible: For the five indicators based on country-modelled data (child stunting, child overweight, low birthweight, anaemia and adult obesity), an assessment is possible for all regions because a modelled estimate exists for all countries, meaning there are enough data to generate representative estimates for all regions and for all years. For indicators where country-modelled estimates are not available, namely child wasting and exclusive breastfeeding, assessment is not possible for regions where population coverage is < 50 percent (see notes 16 and 17 to Table A2.3).", "sentences": [{"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S0", "text": "To determine which progress assessment category to use for each indicator and each region, f irst, two distinct annual rates of reductionbb were calculated: the AARR required for the region to reach the 2030 target; and the actual AARR that the region has experienced to date."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S1", "text": "The value of the actual AARR experienced to date was then used to determine which progress assessment category the region is assigned, while also considering the required AARR."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S2", "text": "See Table A2.3 for AARR ranges and prevalence thresholds applied for each category and for each indicator, brief ly:"}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S4", "text": "On track: regions with an actual AARR that is greater than the required AARR are categorized as being on track to achieve the target."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S5", "text": "A static threshold for the latest prevalence, as noted for each indicator in Table A2.3, is also used to categorize regions as being on track; for example, any region for which the most recent overweight prevalence is below 3 percent is considered on track, even if its actual AARR is less than its required AARR."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S6", "text": " Off track: regions with an actual AARR that is less than the required AARR and for which the latest prevalence is above the on track static threshold noted in Table A2.3 are considered off track."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S7", "text": "The off track category is broken down into different sub-categories depending on the indicator."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S8", "text": "For the four indicators of child stunting, child overweight, child wasting, and anaemia among women, there are three off track sub-categories: off track  some progress, off track  no progress and off track  worsening."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S9", "text": "For low birthweight and exclusive breastfeeding, the categories of off track  no progress and off track  "}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S10", "text": "worsening are combined into one category of off track  no progress or worsening which is represented with an orange colour because there is insufficient bb"}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S11", "text": "See technical note on how to calculate AARR at: https://data. unicef.org/resources/technical-note-calculate-average-annual-ratereduction-aarr-underweight-prevalence variation in the progress to date to use the two categories for these indicators."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S12", "text": "For adult obesity, since the target is no increase, for which the required AARR is  0, it is not possible to have a category of off track  some progress or off track  no progress and therefore only off track  worsening is used."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S14", "text": "For the five indicators based on country-modelled data, an assessment is possible for all regions because a modelled estimate exists for all countries, meaning there are enough data to generate representative estimates for all regions and for all years."}, {"id": "a0eccd29c6779ba2c00f69bea8c41caaba1e5caadd10670c1c981aca460ba140.PG199.PA4.S15", "text": "For indicators where country-modelled estimates are not available, namely child wasting and exclusive breastfeeding, assessment is not possible for regions where population coverage is < 50 percent."}], "entities": []}
