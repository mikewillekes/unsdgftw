Measures taken by governments to contain and mitigate the pandemic have led to widespread disruption in the provision and financing of essential services, including WASH. The global response has had a strong focus on promoting hand hygiene and strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC), and governments have introduced a range of measures designed to keep WASH services running, including emergency financial support to utilities and vulnerable households8. While it is clear the pandemic will have far reaching effects on levels of public and private investment in WASH services, it remains too early to assess the medium and long-term impact on progress towards the SDG WASH targets. 7 World Bank, Updated Estimates of the Impact of COVID-19 on Global Poverty: Looking back at 2020 and the outlook for 2021 <https://blogs.worldbank.org/ opendata/updated-estimates-impact-covid-19-globalpoverty-looking-back-2020-and-outlook-2021>. 8 UNICEF and SIWI, Overview of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) COVID-19 Responses from Governments, Regulators, Utilities and other Stakeholders in 84 Countries, 2020 <https://www.siwi. org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200701_MappingWASH-COVID-19_Key-remarks_v6_clean-Aug-10-.pdf>.", "sentences": [{"id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.S0", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the global economy into recession, with an additional 119 to 124 million people pushed into extreme poverty during 20207."}, {"id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.S1", "text": "Measures taken by governments to contain and mitigate the pandemic have led to widespread disruption in the provision and financing of essential services, including WASH."}, {"id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.S2", "text": "The global response has had a strong focus on promoting hand hygiene and strengthening infection prevention and control, and governments have introduced a range of measures designed to keep WASH services running, including emergency financial support to utilities and vulnerable households8."}, {"id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.S3", "text": "While it is clear the pandemic will have far reaching effects on levels of public and private investment in WASH services, it remains too early to assess the medium and long-term impact on progress towards the SDG WASH targets."}, {"id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.S4", "text": "7 World Bank, Updated Estimates of the Impact of COVID-19 on Global Poverty: Looking back at 2020 and the outlook for 2021 <https://blogs.worldbank.org/ opendata/updated-estimates-impact-covid-19-globalpoverty-looking-back-2020-and-outlook-2021>."}, {"id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.S5", "text": "8 UNICEF and SIWI, Overview of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene COVID-19 Responses from Governments, Regulators, Utilities and other Stakeholders in 84 Countries, 2020 <https://www.siwi. org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200701_MappingWASH-COVID-19_Key-remarks_v6_clean-Aug-10-.pdf>."}], "entities": [{"id": "5bf15391fe73f7654afc971c7c65000720e453bf9af3ea1841c44b1f4ed52238", "mention_id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.EVENT0", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic", "label": "EVENT"}, {"id": "ec80eba460f5b1903b5633ac8a6f00be5d84b2a49a569a9cd37aec94863e40d2", "mention_id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.ORG3", "text": "World Bank", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "623b2b96c7d64680a894827b72c0a8426a7b0425a760b6219ca89f03d3a11b6b", "mention_id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.ORG6", "text": "UNICEF", "label": "ORG"}, {"id": "2ec07897c36a3cb331bc04f8b9776b27c6f3d65f57f2d1f68d684e0f5f407a25", "mention_id": "5d39e0761f9f80cb1833259098f14e96b34fca68c8fa2e25a6962547e11c8a45.PG16.PA4.ORG7", "text": "SIWI", "label": "ORG"}]}
