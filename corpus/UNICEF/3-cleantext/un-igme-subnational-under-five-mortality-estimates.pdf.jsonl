The model contains spatial terms to account for such structure. The beta-binomial distribution is used in the model since it appropriately characterizes the binary outcome distribution and has an additional parameter to accommodate overdispersion, also known as excess binomial variation. The model for deaths at a generic age is, Yc | pc ~ Beta-binomial(nc,pc,d), for c=1,...,C where Yc is the number of deaths out of nc months at risk, and pc = p(sc) is the probability of a death at location sc for c=1,...,C clusters. The parameter d allows for overdispersion and is related to the withincluster correlation between the nc different individuals in the same cluster. The probability is modeled as, p(sc) = expit( + Sc[i] + ec[i]) where Sc[i] and ec[i] are spatial and independent random effects, respectively, specified at at administrative level 2, which is indexed by i; the notation c[i] here should be read as the administrative level 2 area i that cluster c resides in. Hence, all clusters in the administrative level 2 area i receive the same random effects. The spatial terms are assumed to follow an intrinsic conditional autoregressive model.1 The latter is the most popular model for disease mapping in epidemiology, since it is straightforward to fit and has been shown in a multitude of studies to provide reliable estimates.
