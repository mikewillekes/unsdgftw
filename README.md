## **Graph for a Better World:** Enable Search for United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

The Sustainable Development Goals are highly interconnected: for example, goals targeting resilience of the poor and sustainable food production are linked to adverse impacts of climate change and improving food production by combating desertification and improving  soil quality.

At a small scale itâ€™s easy to visually identify these links and interconnected themes, but at a large scale this can be exceedingly difficult. Researchers and domain experts typically publish their findings in lengthy books, scientific papers and institutional reports.

A researcher, development analyst or project coordinator looking for findings that link SDG 2.4 _"sustainable and resilient agricultural practices"_ and SDG 15.3 _"combating desertification and soil restoration"_ in Central America with topics-or-themes of  _"property rights of indigenous communities"_ has to search through hundreds or thousands of pages of PDFs from organizations like:
- [UNICEF](https://data.unicef.org/resources/)
- [The World Bank Open Data Repository](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/)
- [The International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://portals.iucn.org/library/dir/publications-list)
- [Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services](https://ipbes.net/assessing-knowledge)
- [IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/)

## Natural Language Processing and TigerGraph to the Rescue!

The concept of applying Natural Language Processing techniques to extract and construct knowledge graphs from unstructured text is not new. I personally began working on projects in this techncial domain more than ten years ago. However, what once took years of R&D by a team of researchers and engineers, is now achieveable by a proficient solo-developer in a few weeks on commodity hardware. What *has* changed recently is:

- The availability of powerful, pre-trained NLP Language Models
- SaaS graph database platforms, like [TigerGraph](https://www.tigergraph.com/), with great community support and a low barrier to entry

The goal of this project was to build a solution that empowered non-technical (about programming, web-crawling, machine learning or graph databases) users to easily discover links between Documents, SDGs, Entities (people, places and organizations) and Topics, while always retaining the link back to a source document.

This final aspect significanly increased the technical complexity of the solution. Many described and published approaches focus only on extracting and building a Knowledge Graph, presenting their results as a [traditional node-linked diagram](https://www.google.com/search?q=nlp+build+knowledge+graph&tbm=isch&chips=q:nlp+build+knowledge+graph,online_chips:named+entity+recognition), which great for conveying the results to other graph professionals, but difficult to navigate for non-technical users. A user-frendly Web Application front-end would need to be built backed by TigerGraph as the data engine.
